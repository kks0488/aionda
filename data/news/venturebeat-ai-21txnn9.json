His startup, <a href=\"https://listenlabs.ai/\">Listen Labs</a>, needed to hire over 100 engineers, but competing against Mark Zuckerberg&#x27;s <a href=\"https://news.bloomberglaw.com/employee-benefits/zuckerbergs-100-million-ai-job-offers-pay-off-parmy-olson\">$100 million offers</a> seemed impossible. So he spent $5,000 — a fifth of his marketing budget — on a <a href=\"https://billboardinsider.com/ai-startup/\">billboard in San Francisco</a> displaying what looked like gibberish: five strings of random numbers.</p><p>The numbers were actually AI tokens. Decoded, they led to a coding challenge: build an algorithm to act as a digital bouncer at Berghain, the Berlin nightclub famous for rejecting nearly everyone at the door. Within days, thousands attempted the puzzle. 430 cracked it. Some got hired. The winner flew to Berlin, all expenses paid.</p><p>That unconventional approach has now attracted $69 million in Series B funding, led by <a href=\"https://www.ribbitcap.com/\">Ribbit Capital</a> with participation from <a href=\"https://www.evantic.ai/\">Evantic</a> and existing investors <a href=\"https://sequoiacap.com/\">Sequoia Capital</a>, <a href=\"https://www.conviction.com/\">Conviction</a>, and <a href=\"https://pear.vc/\">Pear VC</a>. The round values Listen Labs at $500 million and brings its total capital to $100 million. In nine months since launch, the company has grown annualized revenue by 15x to eight figures and conducted over one million AI-powered interviews.</p><div></div><p>&quot;When you obsess over customers, everything else follows,&quot; Wahlforss said in an interview with VentureBeat. &quot;Teams that use Listen bring the customer into every decision, from marketing to product, and when the customer is delighted, everyone is.&quot;</p><h2><b>Why traditional market research is broken, and what Listen Labs is building to fix it</b></h2><p>Listen&#x27;s <a href=\"https://listenlabs.ai/role/agencies\">AI researcher",
