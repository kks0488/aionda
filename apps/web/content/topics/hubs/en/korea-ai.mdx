Korea AI Pulse focuses on **what actually changes locally**—policy, platform shifts, company moves, and community signals—without turning into pure translation.

## Lens
- In Korea, policy and platform changes often impact products and operations quickly.
- Community signals are useful, but we avoid treating them as authoritative without stronger references.
