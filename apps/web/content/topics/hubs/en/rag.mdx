description: "Retrieval, vector databases, and practical knowledge grounding."

This topic is less about “better search” and more about **reducing confident wrong answers**.  
Retrieval quality, privacy/security, freshness, and operating cost are the core levers.

## Practical checks
- Many “model” failures are actually retrieval failures—debug retrieval first.
- Without clear data access and PII policy, RAG projects often stall in operations.
- If freshness matters, design **re-index cadence** and **evidence display** together.
