This topic focuses on **workload-driven decisions**—where the bottleneck is, what you’re paying for, and what fails at scale.

## How to read hardware posts
- Define your bottleneck first (memory, bandwidth, networking, or software).
- One headline metric rarely explains real performance—stacks and constraints matter.
- Benchmarks depend on conditions; always check reproducibility details.
