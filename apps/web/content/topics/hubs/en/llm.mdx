This topic is less about “what models can do” and more about **when they fail** and **how to operate them safely**.  
We prioritize evergreen concepts, common misconceptions, and practical decision rules.

## Quick orientation
- Read in the order **definition → misconceptions → practice**.
- Compare models by **your constraints** (latency, cost, security, quality), not a single benchmark number.
- Specs and policies change quickly, so always check the **as-of date** inside each post.

## Where to start
- Start with an Explainer to build the mental model,
- then move to HowTo/Troubleshooting posts for operational reality,
- and finish with Deep Dives for clear trade-offs and decision criteria.
