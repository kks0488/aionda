This topic focuses on **what changes mean in practice**—especially the parts that break workflows: limits, billing, account state, policy changes, and operational risk.

## What to check first
- Separate the issue into **outage vs account/billing vs network vs client**.
- Policies, pricing, and limits change frequently—verify against **official docs**.
- Read updates through an operations lens: **cost, rate limits, and security**.
