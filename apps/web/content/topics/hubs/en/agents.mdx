title: "Agents"
description: "Agentic systems, tool use, orchestration, and automation."

This topic is about building **operational agents**, not demos.  
Tool contracts, failure modes, guardrails, and observability matter more than clever prompts.

## Practical criteria
- Automate one task end-to-end first, then expand scope.
- Many failures start at **permissions, data, or tool contracts**.
- Without logs and replay, agents are extremely hard to debug in production.
