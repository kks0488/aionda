Your AI could achieve a top grade on the CSAT. Gemini's math performance has been enhanced by forcing Python code execution. It now reduces errors by directly calculating complex formulas.

## What Happened
A user has released the 'Ailey Math' tool for Gemini. This tool forces the model to execute Python code, allowing it to solve complex calculus problems. It successfully solved common math problems from the CSAT (Suneung) with high accuracy.

## Why It Matters
This tool overcomes the chronic calculation errors typical of AI models. It verifies formulas through code rather than text, resulting in a dramatic leap in logical reasoning capabilities.

## Background
Existing AI models frequently make mistakes in complex computations. A user from 'The Singularity is Near' community developed a solution that changes the model's operational logic via prompt modification. The tool also includes Python-based graph visualization features.

## Future Outlook
User-driven customization for AI performance optimization is accelerating. This serves as a viable alternative until Google's official updates are released. It is expected to transform how AI is utilized in educational environments.

## FAQ
**Q: Is it perfect for all problems?**
A: High-difficulty problems, such as Calculus Question 30, still pose a challenge.

**Q: Is the installation complex?**
A: No, simply copy the text and paste it into the system settings.

**Q: Are there any costs involved?**
A: It is a free, open-source prompt tool.
