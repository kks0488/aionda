Students are now solving CSAT Math Question No. 30 using AI. A new prompt has pushed Gemini's mathematical intelligence to its limits. Your AI can now directly calculate complex calculus.

## What Happened
The developer community has released the 'Ailey Math' prompt. This tool forces Gemini to execute Python code. Artificial intelligence no longer guesses math problems; it now writes its own code and outputs precise calculation results.

## Why It Matters
It has resolved the chronic calculation errors of language models. The code execution method significantly improves the accuracy rate for mathematical problems. Even general users now possess professional-grade math assistance tools.

## Background
Since Gemini is language-based, it often makes mistakes in complex operations. The Korean CSAT Math is one of the most difficult exams for artificial intelligence. Online community developers shared technology to solve this problem. They overcame model limitations through a mandatory code execution option.

## Future Outlook
Mandatory code execution will become standard for all AI models. The landscape of the math academy and tutoring market will change. Artificial intelligence is now evolving beyond simple conversation into an engineering tool.

## FAQ
**Q: How do I use it?**
A: Simply paste the provided specific text into the Gemini settings.

**Q: Does it solve all math problems?**
A: Ultra-high-difficulty problems, such as Calculus Question No. 30, remain a challenge.

**Q: Is this an official Google update?**
A: No. It is a performance-enhancing add-on created by external developers.
