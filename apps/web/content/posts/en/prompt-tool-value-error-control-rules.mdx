# The Instrumental Value of Prompts and Error Control Rules

Conversation with AI is not a technology but an art. Effective prompts must possess instrumental value. This is based on the explicit provision of intent, constraints, and context. The curse of the closed system generates errors. Mutual critical review offers a solution.

## Current Status: Investigated Facts and Data

OpenAI presents six major strategies for prompt optimization. It recommends setting a persona and using delimiters. Complex tasks should be broken down step by step. Anthropic emphasizes the use of XML tags. Structure is separated using tags like `<context>` and `<task>`. Both companies require clear intent communication. Providing examples and specifying constraints are key. This prevents model hallucination.

Academic research validates structural approaches. The Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technique improves reasoning ability. Chain-of-Verification (CoVe) reduces hallucinations. Step-by-step reasoning increases correct answer rates. The verification question process ensures accuracy. However, the Few-shot technique is sensitive to bias. CoT can degrade performance on simple tasks. It may cause hallucinations containing logical errors.

## Analysis: Meaning and Impact

The instrumental value of a prompt is evaluated by its feasibility. The more specific the user's intent, the higher the success rate. Specifying constraints determines output quality. Providing context enhances the model's understanding. All these elements must be combined systematically.

The curse of the closed system is a major cause of error. Information loss occurs between the user and the LLM. Mutual critical review solves this problem. Systematic questioning clarifies context. The use of representativeness heuristics should be prohibited. A minimalist structure ensures output reliability.

## Practical Application: Methods Readers Can Utilize

Explicitly separate intent, constraints, and context. Actively utilize XML tags or delimiters. Break down complex tasks into smaller steps. Request rationale and logic for each step.

Ask the model to verify before output. Question with "What is the basis for this conclusion?" Include questions that confirm the user's context. Select and arrange examples carefully. Do not apply CoT to simple tasks.

## FAQ

**Q: What is the 'curse of the closed system'?**
A: It refers to errors that occur when users and LLMs exchange information within a closed system. The core problem is information loss due to a lack of mutual understanding.

**Q: What are the main limitations of the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technique?**
A: Performance may degrade on simple tasks. The 'curse of CoT' phenomenon occurs. It can induce hallucinations containing logical errors.

**Q: What are the advantages of the XML tags recommended by Anthropic?**
A: They structurally separate components within a prompt. They help the model clearly distinguish between instructions and context. This contributes to preventing hallucinations.

## Conclusion

Maximize the instrumental value of prompts. Explicitly provide intent, constraints, and context. Introduce structural approaches and verification processes. Now apply these principles to your prompts.
