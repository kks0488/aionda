# Enhancing the Instrumental Value of Prompts and Controlling AI Errors

Effective AI prompting is closer to designing precise tools than to giving simple commands. Success can be evaluated by the 'instrumental value' of a prompt—its potential to realize user intent. To enhance this value and reduce unintentional errors and information loss during interactions with AI, a systematic approach is necessary.

## Current Status: Investigated Facts and Data

OpenAI and Anthropic provide specific guidelines for optimizing prompt components. OpenAI recommends providing clear instructions, using delimiters to separate instructions from context, setting specific personas, and explicitly specifying output formats. Anthropic particularly emphasizes structuring tasks, context, and constraints using XML tags, and techniques like pre-filling the beginning of a response to give the model time to think. Both companies commonly advise breaking down complex tasks into sub-steps, using positive instructions, and including sufficient background information while reducing unnecessary details considering token efficiency.

Academic research on reducing LLM hallucinations demonstrates the effectiveness of structured reasoning. The 'LogiCoT' paper proposes a framework that applies symbolic logic principles to validate the soundness of step-by-step reasoning, significantly reducing logical errors and hallucinations. Research on 'Chain-of-Thought' and 'Chain-of-Verification' also shows that stepwise reasoning and independent verification of factual relationships are effective in suppressing hallucinations.

Few-shot Prompting and Chain-of-Thought techniques are widely used to extract user intent and clarify context. Few-shot Prompting, which provides a few examples, increases response consistency, while Chain-of-Thought improves the accuracy of intent understanding in complex contexts by making intermediate reasoning steps explicit. However, recent research on the 'Curse of CoT' points out that CoT can increase contextual distance, degrading pattern-based learning performance, and highlights limitations such as outcome variability depending on example selection and high computational cost.

## Analysis: Meaning and Impact

These facts suggest that the 'instrumental value' of a prompt is based on three explicitly provided elements: intent, constraints, and context. It is akin to providing blueprints and specifications to a precision machine. Only when the AI model is separately conveyed 'what' to do, 'how' to do it, and 'under what conditions,' can we expect outputs that align with the user's goals.

Errors that occur between LLMs and users primarily stem from the 'curse of the closed system.' This refers to the phenomenon where incomplete information or ambiguity included in the initial prompt is amplified within the closed dialogue flow. The key mechanisms to address this are mutual critical review and systematic questioning. Requiring a 'evidence-logic-conclusion' structure or introducing steps where the model verifies its own answers are strategies to open this closed system and preemptively block error possibilities.

## Practical Application: Methods Readers Can Use

First, when writing a prompt, explicitly separate intent, constraints, and context using delimiters or XML tags. For example, follow the intent ("Please answer as follows") with constraints ("Adhere to the following format"), and then provide context ("Refer to the following background information").

Second, when requesting complex tasks, demand a minimalist 'evidence-logic-conclusion' structure. By having the model narrate its thought process step-by-step, you can trace the source of errors. Simultaneously, ask direct questions like "What is the background of this question?" to clarify ambiguous user context, and avoid assumptions based on representativeness heuristics like "as most people think."

## FAQ

**Q: What is the most important point to note when giving Few-shot examples?**
A: Outcome variability depending on example selection is a major limitation. The provided examples should not contradict each other and must clearly demonstrate the core pattern of the requested task. Inappropriate examples can actually degrade performance.

**Q: Does 'Chain-of-Thought' always guarantee good results?**
A: No. As pointed out by the 'Curse of CoT' research, excessive or inappropriately applied CoT can increase contextual distance and produce counterproductive effects. For simple, fact-based questions, requesting direct answers may be more efficient.

**Q: How do I implement the 'pre-filling the response' technique emphasized by Anthropic?**
A: It's a method of pre-writing and providing the beginning part of the model's response in the prompt. For example, by presenting a starting phrase like "The following is a step-by-step reasoning for the problem: 1.", you increase the likelihood that the model will think and respond following that structure.

## Conclusion

Effective AI prompting is a cyclical process of structured command design and continuous error control. To imbue prompts with instrumental value, explicitly separate intent, constraints, and context, and manage potential errors in closed systems through open review and structured reasoning. The next time you converse with AI, consider that you are holding a tool to design collaboration, not just giving commands.
