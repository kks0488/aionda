# The Age of Superintelligence: Labor Beyond Survival and the Rediscovery of Life's Meaning

With the realization of superintelligence (AGI/ASI) imminent, humanity is facing the possibility of being liberated from 'instrumental labor' for survival for the first time in history. This is not merely a technological advancement but a fundamental paradigm shift that resets the very essence of human existence and the purpose of life itself. We now stand at a point where we must rewrite the definition of prosperity.

## Current Status: Investigated Facts and Data

Reports from major tech companies and researchers predict the realization of superintelligence between 2029 and 2030. OpenAI defines AGI as 'a system that outperforms humans in most economically valuable work' and aims for its realization around 2030. DeepMind has proposed a 5-level AGI classification system based on performance and generality, forecasting the emergence of early-stage AGI within the next 5 to 10 years.

The economic impact of this technological progress is already becoming visible. Research indicates that approximately 80% of the U.S. workforce will see automation impact at least 10% of their tasks, while 19% may see half or more of their tasks affected. This signifies a broad reorganization of job content rather than the complete disappearance of specific occupations.

## Analysis: Meaning and Impact

The premise that superintelligence could make labor for survival and basic prosperity unnecessary shakes the very foundations of our society. John Maynard Keynes predicted as early as 1930 that technological progress would lead to a 15-hour workweek society around 2030. Modern researchers, such as Frey and Osborne, continue to warn about technological unemployment, analyzing that 47% of U.S. jobs are at high risk of automation.

Experimental data on how such changes affect human happiness and sense of purpose provides interesting insights. Basic income experiments conducted in Finland and Stockton, USA, showed that decoupling labor and income can significantly improve subjective well-being and mental health. In the Finnish experiment, recipients' life satisfaction scored 7.3, higher than the control group. This suggests that liberation from labor for survival can secure the autonomy to dedicate oneself to creative and socially valuable activities, potentially forming a new sense of purpose.

## Practical Application: Methods Readers Can Utilize

This wave of change is not a story of the distant future. When designing current career choices and learning paths, it is necessary to consider capabilities resilient to automation. This means moving beyond simply learning to code, towards enhancing uniquely human abilities such as complex problem definition, creative integration, and social interaction.

Simultaneously, we need to actively engage in philosophical conversations about 'life after labor' as individuals and members of society. Initiating discussions in local communities about models for a post-labor society, such as basic income, universal basic services, and citizen engagement jobs, can be a practical first step.

## FAQ: 3 Questions

**Q: If superintelligence replaces all jobs, what will people do for a living?**
A: Technological progress tends to reorganize tasks rather than completely eliminate jobs. Basic income experiment data shows that people freed from livelihood worries allocate more time to areas of personal and social significance, such as childcare, learning, volunteering, and creative activities. The center of life is likely to shift from 'subsistence labor' to 'purpose-driven activities'.

**Q: At what pace will technological development replace jobs?**
A: Current predictions focus on a gradual and uneven impact. Even if superintelligence is realized around 2030, it will not be applied simultaneously and at the same level across all industries and jobs. About 19% of jobs are expected to be relatively quickly affected (over 50% of tasks) by automation, and this process will involve both job restructuring and the creation of new jobs.

**Q: Will Keynes's predicted 15-hour workweek society be realized?**
A: Keynes's prediction offers insight into technological potential, but it is difficult to realize without actual changes in social institutions and distribution structures. Despite technology's ability to dramatically increase productivity, there is a risk it could lead to expanding income and wealth inequality rather than reduced working hours. Therefore, a new social contract linking reduced working hours and basic livelihood security will be a key challenge.

## Conclusion: Summary + Action Proposal

The age of superintelligence heralds the end of labor for survival, which is an opportunity to open a new chapter for humanity, not a crisis. The key lies not in the technology itself, but in our collective choices about how to define and distribute the abundance it creates, and for what purpose we will use the liberated time and energy. We must now move beyond labor as a tool for livelihood and explore the more fundamental meaning that constitutes life.
