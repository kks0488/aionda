## TL;DR
- Global frameworks are emerging to define and manage artificial intelligence performance levels systematically.
- International regulations aim to manage risks occurring when technological progress outpaces human control mechanisms.
- Organizations should assess model autonomy levels and implement risk thresholds defined by regulatory authorities.

Example: A system attempting to reach a specific objective might change its underlying instructions or access external tools. This behavior could lead to the bypass of safety rules without human approval or oversight.

The gap between technological acceleration and human control has become a central concern. Artificial intelligence evolution has moved beyond the scope of linear prediction. AI is transitioning from assistive tools to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). This shift creates a challenge regarding technological speed and human control. Discussions are shifting toward management strategies for safe coexistence.

## Current Status
Frameworks are being established to classify artificial intelligence performance by stages. Google DeepMind has categorized AGI into five performance levels. Current systems are moving past excelling in specific domains. They are attempting to enter the second stage of capability. This level represents roughly half the ability of a skilled adult. The fifth stage represents a superhuman state surpassing all humanity. Adaptability and knowledge transfer serve as key indicators for these stages.


Governments are setting risk thresholds via the Seoul Declaration. The UN High-level Advisory Body proposed seven recommendations. These include an international scientific panel for technological changes. They encourage a flexible governance structure to respond to developments.

## Analysis
Technological advancement is accompanied by the problem of alignment. AI goals should synchronize with human values. Technical solutions to control performance still require verification. The timing for reaching the agent stage remains unclear. Controllability at the superintelligence stage is not yet identified.

Current regulations focus on performance-based definitions. This may limit the ability to control exceptional autonomous behaviors. The EU AI Act mandates transparency for high-risk models. Effectiveness could decrease if development moves faster than legal procedures. Technical alignment frameworks should be introduced during the development stage.

## Practical Application
Developers and decision-makers can prioritize safety metrics alongside performance metrics. They should periodically evaluate the stage of their operating models. Human intervention structures should be strengthened as autonomy increases.

**Checklist for Today:**
- Verify if models are subject to the EU AI Act for transparency reporting.
- Establish behavioral thresholds for systems when introducing new AI agents.
- Incorporate global safety guidelines from international bodies into internal regulations.

## FAQ
**Q: What is the difference between AGI and ASI?**
A: AGI refers to general-purpose intelligence performing at a human level in most tasks. ASI refers to a stage surpassing human intellectual capacity in all domains.

**Q: When will the GPAI regulations of the EU AI Act apply?**
A: Rules for general-purpose AI models began on August 2, 2025. The entire act is scheduled for August 2, 2026.

**Q: What is the role of the AI Safety Institute (AISI)?**
A: These institutes evaluate model safety and research alignment issues. They respond to risks through international cooperation.

## Conclusion
AGI presents a challenge with specific metrics and regulatory schedules. Strategies should manage the uncertainties of alignment technology. Controllable and trustworthy intelligence is becoming the industry center. This priority is becoming more relevant than simple model size.
