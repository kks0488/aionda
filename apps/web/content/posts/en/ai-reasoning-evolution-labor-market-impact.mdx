## TL;DR
- Artificial intelligence models are approaching a technical tipping point toward human-level cognitive abilities, achieving high performance in complex reasoning and mathematical benchmarks.
- As 60% of jobs in advanced economies are projected to be affected by AI.
The potential for simultaneous productivity gains and job displacement is being raised.
- Work methods should be redesigned, shifting from simple execution to verifying AI-generated outputs and formulating unique strategies.

Example.
Instead of a manager manually organizing numerous documents to write a market analysis report, they simply set target metrics, and the AI collects information, reviews logical flaws, and derives the final strategic proposal on its own.

## Current Status: Generational Shift Toward 'Reasoners' and Performance Improvements
As of January 2026, the AI market has moved beyond simple language models toward a focus on reasoning. Since the release of DeepSeek-R1 in January 2025, which recorded an MMLU of 88.5% and HumanEval of 90.2%, top-tier models have consistently delivered high performance in professional knowledge assessment benchmarks.


Corporate roadmaps are also becoming more concrete. OpenAI classifies systems into five levels, aiming to build systems that outperform humans in economically valuable tasks. Anthropic is also preparing for the era by forecasting the attainment of human-level intelligence between 2026 and 2027 through its safety-centric ASL (AI Safety Level) framework.

## Analysis: Labor Market Changes and Productivity Structure
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has likened these changes to a large wave in the labor market, analyzing that approximately 40% of global employment—and 60% in advanced economies—will be directly impacted by AI. This signifies that, unlike past automation which focused on manual labor, cognitive labor performed by highly educated professionals is now being integrated into the order of automation.

According to surveys by the OECD and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the adoption of AI is driving a labor productivity improvement of approximately 4% at the corporate level. Regarding skill demand, the need for skills related to creativity and originality has expanded from 25% to 33%, surpassing the demand for conventional simple task proficiency. This indicates that the value of framing questions and judging context has become relatively higher.

However, limitations and concerns persist. The upward standardization of performance is weakening the discriminative power of existing benchmarks, and there is a lack of certainty regarding whether productivity gains will lead to actual wage increases or improved quality of life. Furthermore, uncertainty remains regarding the timing of reaching certain milestones, as the technical requirements for advancing beyond specific levels have not been clearly disclosed.

## Practical Application: Utilizing Intelligent Agents and Securing Verification Competencies
Individuals and enterprises should utilize AI not merely as a search tool, but as an autonomous agent capable of independent task execution. In an environment where cognitive labor is automated, the core competency shifts from the ability to create outputs to the capacity to verify and integrate logical validity.

Developers should allocate more time to inspecting security vulnerabilities and designing architectures rather than manually writing code. Planners should delegate data research to agents and focus on strategic decision-making while correcting potential biases.

**Checklist for Today:**
- Identify three repetitive tasks in your workflow, such as data summarization or drafting, and experiment with delegating them to AI for automation.
- Create your own verification checklist to identify logical leaps or errors in AI-generated outputs.
- Regularly monitor changes in professional benchmarks in line with the pace of technological evolution to assess the need for job transitions.

## FAQ
**Q: Will all white-collar jobs disappear as AI becomes more advanced?**
A: A restructuring of job roles is more likely than simple replacement. According to IMF and OECD reports, AI increases the demand for creativity and originality. The World Bank emphasizes that new opportunities are being created, with related job postings increasing by 16% in upper-middle-income countries.

**Q: Can current model performance benchmarks be trusted?**
A: Caution is required. While major models have reached peak scores on benchmarks, these results may be optimized for specific datasets. There is critical view that, due to benchmark saturation, perceived performance in actual professional environments may differ from these metrics.

**Q: How are companies ensuring safety?**
A: Anthropic has introduced ASL levels to strengthen safety standards in tandem with performance advancements. However, the specific measurement methods for the standards proposed by each company and enforceable international regulations are still in the process of being established.

## Conclusion
Technological leaps are a reality currently unfolding in 2026. As major models achieve human-level benchmarks in reasoning and logic, the value of cognitive labor is shifting from execution to design and verification.

The focus moving forward will be on how quickly these technological achievements translate into productivity in actual industrial fields. It is time to hone strategic judgment to use these advancements as tools for value creation in response to the acceleration of technology.
