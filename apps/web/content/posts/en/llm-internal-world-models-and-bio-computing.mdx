## TL;DR
- Large Language Models can form internal representations of space and time during the training process.
- These internal world models may improve logical consistency and could eventually leverage energy-efficient bio-computing.
- Users should evaluate model reasoning and monitor emerging low-power hardware developments periodically.

Example: Imagine a digital mind wandering through a forest of words and slowly painting a map of the trees.

## Current Status: Digital Maps Formed Within Text
Large Language Models might learn physical world structures beyond simple word prediction.
Research suggests Llama-2 could generate neurons responding to latitude, longitude, and time.
These findings indicate models may identify physical linear structures within data.
Qwen2.5 can also induce logical arrangements during unsupervised learning.
However, maintaining such intelligence requires significant energy.
Silicon semiconductors consume about $10^{-9}$ Joules per operation.
Bio-computing using DNA molecules requires approximately $5 \times 10^{-20}$ Joules.
This suggests bio-computing could perform more calculations for the same energy input.

## Analysis: Achievements in Abstraction and Hardware Challenges
An internal world model can indicate if an AI possesses conceptual understanding.
Models representing space and time can potentially place new information into existing systems.
AI might locate coordinates on an internal map to retrieve climate information.
Some researchers suggest these maps do not confirm human-level causal understanding.
Models may perform 40% lower than humans in tasks requiring physical concept understanding.
Current world models could be sophisticated correlations rather than fundamental insights.
Energy efficiency remains a challenge for advanced intelligence.
Silicon architectures process signals sequentially, which increases power consumption.
Bio-computing can potentially leverage trillions of molecules for parallel operations.
The timeline for commercializing large-scale bio-integrated circuits is currently uncertain.

## Practical Application: World Models as Business Competitiveness
Corporations can view LLMs as tools for building domain-specific world models.
Ensuring models accurately map business processes is a key factor for optimization.

**Checklist for Today:**
- Evaluate if current models accurately infer causal relationships and spatio-temporal contexts.
- Review technological trends in low-power computing or bio-based hardware every quarter.
- Utilize prompting frameworks that encourage models to explain their internal logical structures.

## FAQ
**Q: Is the world model just memorization?**
A: Research indicates models can perform logical reconstructions even for unfamiliar states.

**Q: Can bio-computing replace silicon GPUs soon?**
A: This seems difficult at present.
Bio-computing lacks the versatility required by the current computing ecosystem.
It might first appear as a special-purpose accelerator in hybrid systems.

**Q: What does it mean that the model's physical understanding is 40% behind?**
A: Models often miss common-sense judgments made by humans when reasoning through physical situations.
Training data reflecting physical properties should be reinforced to compensate for this.

## Conclusion
LLMs are building internal maps that extend beyond text.
Spatial and temporal neurons suggest AI is perceiving the world as a structure.
The utility of AI should increase as these mechanisms become more sophisticated.
We can monitor the potential transition from silicon to molecular hardware.
Future competition may focus on consistency and efficiency rather than scale.
