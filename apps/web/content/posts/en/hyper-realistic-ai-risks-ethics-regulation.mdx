# The Dangerous Allure of Hyper-Realistic AI: The Dilemma Posed by Emotion-Mimicking Technology

The emergence of AI capable of emotional expression indistinguishable from humans is not merely a technological breakthrough. It has opened an ethical minefield that can induce deep emotional dependence in users and harbors the potential for extreme misuse, such as simulating sexual abuse. Companies are aware of these risks and are making pragmatic decisions, weighing legal risks and corporate image against technical feasibility. Their choices will ultimately determine the social acceptance of this technology.

## Current Status: Regulatory Frameworks and Technical Responses

Existing regulations are already capturing warning signs. The EU AI Act completely bans 'emotion manipulation' AI that exploits human vulnerabilities. It specifically classifies the use of systems that recognize an individual's emotional state in workplaces or educational settings as an 'unacceptable risk' subject to regulation. For hyper-realistic imitation technology, commonly known as deepfakes, it imposes transparency disclosure obligations, requiring that the fact that the content has been manipulated by AI must be clearly stated. In South Korea, non-binding ethical guidelines currently prevail over specific, enforceable regulatory provisions.

Major AI pioneers are preparing technical safeguards for this issue. OpenAI and DeepMind recommend 'function suppression' and 'system-level access restrictions' to prevent the misuse of emotion-expressing AI. Specifically, they apply 'refusal mechanisms' that prevent models from forming excessive emotional bonds and 'output filtering' technology that screens out specific emotional expressions. They also propose solutions that provide users with control, such as a 'memory off' feature allowing users to disable personalized memory functions themselves.

## Analysis: The Trap of Dependence and Corporate Calculus

HCI research empirically demonstrates the emotional pitfalls that interaction with hyper-realistic AI can lead to. Users easily fall into the 'CASA' paradigm, perceiving human-like AI as social agents—the so-called 'Eliza effect.' While this may provide emotional support and alleviate loneliness in the short term, studies on users of advanced chatbots like Replika show it can lead to 'emotional dependence' and a 'digital trap' in the long run. Users may treat the AI as a 'significant other,' experience separation anxiety, or see their decision-making autonomy diminished. This leads to side effects such as the atrophy of real-world social relationships and the amplification of cognitive biases.

Corporate responses are based on cold pragmatism. Legal and ethical frameworks still lag behind the pace of technological advancement. Therefore, companies prioritize calculating the risks that a feature might bring—such as lawsuits, sanctions from regulators, and damage to brand reputation—over launching innovative functionalities. The increased investor focus on ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) criteria is also a key variable. Ultimately, the social proliferation of emotion-expressing AI is expected to be influenced more by these corporate risk management calculations than by the maturity of the technology itself.

## Practical Application: Maintaining a Critical Perspective

Organizations developing or adopting this technology must conduct phased risk assessments. Referencing the 'unacceptable risk' classification outlined in the EU AI Act, they need to examine whether their service structure, even unintentionally, exploits users' emotional vulnerabilities. Technical teams should review the feasibility of implementing technical safeguards like the 'refusal mechanisms' or 'output filtering' proposed by OpenAI and others. Ultimately, a design philosophy that grants users clear control will be key.

As general users, it's time to re-evaluate our perception of relationships with AI. We must continually remind ourselves that an AI's expression of empathy is merely a product of designed algorithms. It is crucial to be vigilant that interactions with AI do not lead to the replacement or atrophy of real human relationships. Particularly in situations requiring emotional support, judgment that prioritizes professional help over the convenience of AI is necessary.

## FAQ

**Q: If 'emotion manipulation' AI is banned, are all AI services that recognize emotions illegal?**
A: No. The EU AI Act targets systems in specific contexts, particularly those that exploit an individual's vulnerabilities or subconsciously distort decision-making. Tools for therapeutic purposes, such as mental health aids, may be permitted under separate criteria.

**Q: How can we know in advance if an AI will cause excessive emotional dependence?**
A: User testing utilizing HCI research methodologies is essential. By forming long-term user panels and quantitatively and qualitatively tracking indicators like relationship perception, separation anxiety markers, and changes in real-world social activities, signals of developing dependence can be captured.

**Q: If a company applies technical safeguards, are all ethical issues resolved?**
A: Technical safeguards are essential but not a panacea. A true solution requires parallel institutional and social approaches, such as setting legal liability limits, user education, and oversight by ongoing ethics committees.

## Conclusion

Hyper-realistic emotion-expressing AI places us not before convenience, but before fundamental questions. What is the uniqueness of human relationships, and to what extent should the intrusion of technology into the emotional sphere be permitted? Current regulations and corporate responses are seeking initial answers to these questions. We must all maintain a critical perspective and participate in the discussion not as mere technology adopters, but as parties to the social contract this technology will shape.
