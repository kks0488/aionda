Artificial intelligence (AI), which once focused on finding information in search bars, has now begun reading police bodycam footage and investigative reports. As Perplexity enters the public safety field with 'Perplexity for Public Safety Organizations,' Silicon Valley technology is attempting to fundamentally change the way law enforcement is executed. This attempt to support practical public sector decisions directly linked to life and death, going beyond simple information retrieval, stands on a razor's edge between technical efficiency and human rights violations.

## From Search Engine to Investigative Assistant: Perplexity's Strategy for the Policing Market

The core of this partnership introduced by Perplexity is the enhancement of 'administrative intelligence' for field agents. This differs from existing public safety solutions that focus on providing cloud infrastructure, like Microsoft, or specific companies focusing on 'Predictive Policing' to forecast crimes. Perplexity provides answers by combining investigative reports, case law, and social media data, as well as transcripts from police bodycams, with real-time web information.

The most notable aspect is the aggressive adoption policy. Perplexity has set out to secure initial market share by providing the 'Enterprise Pro' version, dedicated to public safety, free of charge for 12 months. It features mobile-optimized functions so that field agents can identify information via voice or images while on the move, and it transparently discloses the source of information by attaching clear citations to every answer.

Users can choose from various models such as GPT-4o or Claude 3 according to their preferences. This is a strategy to distribute the risk of bias or judgment errors inherent in specific algorithms. It employs a structure that increases answer accuracy by cross-referencing external data with internal agency data in real-time through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology.

## When Hallucinations Change Verdicts: Foreseen Risks and Legal Blind Spots

Despite technical safeguards, expert perspectives remain skeptical. If the 'hallucination' phenomenon—where AI presents non-existent facts as truth—occurs in policing, it can lead directly to human rights violations or incorrect legal judgments. If an investigator applies for a warrant or interrogates a suspect based on incorrect summary information provided by AI, the responsibility falls entirely on the field official.

Current major regulatory frameworks, such as the EU AI Act, classify policing as a 'high-risk area.' They mandate the 'Human-in-the-loop' principle, which dictates that human beings must make the final judgment regardless of how sophisticated the technology is. Legally, AI is merely an auxiliary tool. If an accident occurs due to an AI error, the primary responsibility lies with the operating law enforcement agency. While developers could be held liable through product liability laws, proving design defects is extremely difficult due to the unpredictable nature of AI.

A more concerning point is the standard for 'trusted sources.' While Perplexity emphasizes transparent citations, it has not yet released a specific list of whether there is a separate external algorithm auditing system for removing bias specialized for policing, or what criteria are used to select data for public safety. The lack of transparency that arises when the algorithmic 'black box' is combined with public power remains an unresolved task.

## Practical Application: The Right Approach to Bringing AI into Policing

If public safety agencies adopt Perplexity’s tools, they must start by defining the AI as a 'librarian' rather than a 'decision-maker.' Summaries of investigative reports or case law analyses provided by AI must undergo a cross-verification process against original data. In particular, for information where subjectivity is likely to intervene, such as bodycam transcripts or social media data, one must not blindly trust the AI's interpretation.

Field agents should be trained to verify whether the citations provided by AI are actual documents and whether they were cited in the proper context. Rather than being preoccupied with the cost benefit of the 12-month free offer, agencies should first check security systems to ensure internal data does not leak to external models and establish guidelines for potential legal disputes arising from AI answers.

## FAQ

**Q1: How does Perplexity's public safety AI differ from other general models?**
**A1:** Unlike general searches, it generates answers by combining real-time web information with internal, non-public agency data such as investigative reports and bodycam transcripts. In particular, it attempts to secure legal evidentiary value through a citation feature that specifies sources for all answers and provides a mobile-specific enterprise environment with enhanced voice and image recognition functions for field agents.

**Q2: Who is responsible if a human rights violation occurs because the AI provided incorrect information?**
**A2:** Under the current legal system, the law enforcement agency and the official who made the final judgment bear primary responsibility. This is because AI is considered an auxiliary tool to assist in decision-making. To hold the developer, Perplexity, accountable, significant design defects must be proven, which is a legally complex procedure. Therefore, human review (Human-in-the-loop) in the field is essential.

**Q3: Can policing agencies use this service for free?**
**A3:** Perplexity has a policy of providing 'Enterprise Pro' features free of charge for 12 months to public safety organizations. This is interpreted as a strategy to increase market share by lowering initial adoption barriers. However, after the free period ends, agencies must check their individual contracts regarding cost structures or data management methods.

## Conclusion: The Speed of Technology and the Weight of Public Interest

Perplexity's entry into the policing market signifies that AI has moved beyond a simple convenience tool and into the most sensitive areas of society: 'safety' and 'justice.' While the efficiency of information retrieval will increase dramatically, the risks posed by algorithmic bias and hallucinations remain ongoing.

What we must focus on moving forward is not the flashy features of the technology, but a transparent system capable of monitoring that technology. To ensure that judgments made by AI under the name of public safety do not infringe upon the basic rights of citizens, rigorous auditing of algorithms and a clear establishment of legal liability must follow. Technology may lighten the hands of investigators, but it cannot replace the weight of judgment they carry.
