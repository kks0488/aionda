# The Practical Capability of AI Math Coaches: Are Benchmark Scores Reliable?

Large language models now position themselves as coaches to help solve college entrance exam math problems. However, a gap may exist between the high scores recorded on official benchmarks and their ability to solve actual complex problems. Users must accurately understand the correctness and limitations of the explanations provided by AI to utilize them effectively.

## Current Status: Investigated Facts and Data

The official technical reports for the Gemini model family show their mathematical reasoning capabilities in numbers. Gemini Ultra (1.0) achieved 94.4% accuracy on GSM8K, a dataset of middle school-level math problems. On the more challenging MATH benchmark, it scored 53.2%. The subsequent model, Gemini 1.5 Pro, achieved 91.7% on GSM8K. According to the latest model performance reports, Gemini 2.5 Pro showed 88.0% performance on AIME 2025, a problem from the American Mathematics Competitions. Gemini 3 Pro's Deep Think mode demonstrated progress by recording 93.8% accuracy on GPQA Diamond, a dataset of high-difficulty reasoning problems in science and medicine.

Independent comparative evaluations using actual 2026 College Scholastic Ability Test (CSAT) questions also exist. In a test evaluating the problem-solving performance of major large language models, Gemini 3 ranked first overall with a total score of 440.2 points (out of 450). GPT-5.1 received scores between 433 and 435 points, sometimes achieving perfect scores in the Math and English sections. This evaluation also included Korean-specific models for comparison.

## Analysis: Meaning and Impact

Official benchmark scores and evaluations using actual CSAT problems illuminate different aspects. The high scores in official reports measure the model's pure reasoning ability and problem comprehension in a standardized environment. In contrast, evaluations with real CSAT problems test comprehensive application ability, including unique Korean-language context, multi-step calculations, and exam-specific pitfalls. The discrepancy between the two results becomes an indicator of how well a model transfers its theoretical capabilities to real, complex scenarios.

User experience provides another dimension of analysis. Some users report using AI coaches to assist with problem-solving but point out that AI explanations can be inaccurate or incomplete, especially for the highest-difficulty problems like Calculus problem number 30. Furthermore, implicit comparisons among users suggest there may be differences in grading results or explanation quality between the freely provided 'Fast mode' and the paid 'Pro mode'. This implies that performance may vary depending on accessibility and cost structure.

## Practical Application: Methods Readers Can Use

To use an AI math coach effectively, one must recognize its strengths and weaknesses. The model can be useful for explaining concepts and guiding through basic problem-solving processes. However, rather than blindly accepting all answers presented by the AI, users should critically review them, especially the final answers to complex problems. It is advisable to treat the AI's explanation as one reference point, comparing it with one's own reasoning process to check understanding.

When encountering high-difficulty problems, one should not rely excessively on the AI's responses. The model may misunderstand subtle conditions of a problem or accumulate errors in multi-step calculation processes. Users should try following the solution path provided by the AI but develop the habit of verifying the logical validity at each step themselves. It must be remembered that the AI coach is ultimately an auxiliary tool, and the final responsibility for understanding and mastery lies with the learner.

## FAQ: 3 Questions

**Q: How well can Gemini actually solve CSAT math problems?**
A: In the evaluation using actual 2026 CSAT questions, Gemini 3 was reported to have scored 440.2 points out of 450. This corresponds to a very high overall score, but it does not mean it solved all problems perfectly. For specific high-difficulty problems, there is a possibility of incorrect answers or incomplete solutions.

**Q: Is there a performance difference between the free and paid versions of the AI coach?**
A: User cases suggest implicit comparisons that there may be differences in grading results or explanation quality between 'Fast mode' (free) and 'Pro mode' (paid). However, the investigation results do not present direct comparative data explicitly confirming differences in math problem-solving accuracy between the two modes.

**Q: Are there specific types of math problems that AI finds particularly difficult?**
A: According to user reports, AI may show limitations on problems requiring high-difficulty, multi-step reasoning, such as CSAT Calculus problem number 30. Official benchmarks also show that accuracy on the MATH dataset (high school math problems) is lower than on GSM8K (middle school math problems), confirming the tendency for AI performance to decline as problem difficulty increases.

## Conclusion: Summary + Actionable Advice

AI math coaches have established themselves as powerful auxiliary tools, but their capabilities clearly have limits. While benchmark scores are impressive, errors can occur when facing real, complex problems. Learners should maintain an attitude of critically reviewing AI explanations and utilize AI as a tool to expand and verify their own thought processes. The ultimate goal should not be dependence on AI but rather using interaction with AI to grow one's own mathematical thinking ability.
