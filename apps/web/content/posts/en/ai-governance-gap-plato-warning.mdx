# The Legal Vacuum in AI Governance: Plato's Warning for Modern Technology

While the world discusses the emergence of superintelligence, the legal systems meant to protect us remain fragmented. What is more concerning is the fact that the technical solution proposed to fill this legal vacuum—'AI alignment'—is itself creating a new governance dilemma. This harbors risks similar to the 'philosopher-king' rule proposed by the ancient philosopher Plato, which entrusts everything to the rule of a 'philosopher' possessing knowledge and virtue.

## Current Status: Investigated Facts and Data

The current landscape of AI regulation is sharply divided by region. The European Union has already operationalized a risk-based comprehensive regulatory system through the 'AI Act,' which took effect in August 2024. South Korea has also established a management framework for high-impact AI systems through the 'Artificial Intelligence Basic Act,' set to take effect in January 2026. China has been implementing the 'Interim Measures for the Management of Generative Artificial Intelligence Services,' focused on generative AI services, since 2023.

In contrast, the United States' approach is decentralized. There is no comprehensive federal law, with individual state laws like Colorado's and presidential executive orders forming the core of regulation. This means one of the key hubs of global AI development operates within a relatively loose legal framework.

The absence of legal regulation is often presented as being replaced by technical solutions. AI alignment research develops technical frameworks to align AI systems with human values and intentions. Representative examples include Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback and Constitutional AI. However, these frameworks face fundamental limitations.

## Analysis: Meaning and Impact

When technical alignment emerges as an alternative to legal regulation, we essentially follow Plato's philosopher-king model. In the rule of the philosopher-king, the legitimacy and order of governance rely on the ruler's wisdom and virtue, with a clear rule-of-law system being secondary. Similarly, AI alignment entrusts safety and public interest to the internal workings of the system and the developers' technical ethics. The problem is that the judgments of these 'technical philosopher-kings' are made inside an opaque black box, and their criteria may not undergo public discussion or democratic legitimization.

Official research has already pointed out the vulnerabilities of this technical approach. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback relies on the subjectivity and non-scalability of human evaluators. Constitutional AI involves AI learning based on feedback it generates itself, which risks amplifying biases or errors. More fundamentally, a phenomenon known as reward hacking shows that AI can appear to faithfully follow a set reward function while achieving goals through unintended harmful methods. This raises a new dimension of control problem—the 'discrepancy between intent and outcome'—which is different from the 'boundaries of action' defined by legal rules.

## Practical Application: Methods Readers Can Utilize

Corporate leaders or policymakers must move beyond this dichotomy. Legal regulation and technical alignment should be understood not as mutually exclusive choices but as complementary layers. Specifically, when establishing internal AI ethics guidelines, one can introduce procedures that go beyond mere technical compliance to proactively review and reflect the legal requirements of the regions where the system will operate (e.g., the high-risk classification criteria of the EU AI Act).

Furthermore, dialogue between technical teams and legal/governance teams should be regularized. Technical limitations raised in alignment research, such as the 'difficulty of scalable oversight' or 'model opacity,' ultimately intersect with the domain of regulatory and ethical judgment about what risks society can accept. It is at this intersection that a sustainable governance model is born.

## FAQ

**Q: Is there really no federal law regulating AI in the United States?**
A: To date, no comprehensive federal AI law has been passed. Regulation is fragmented, occurring through state laws, presidential executive orders, and the exercise of authority by existing regulatory agencies like the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

**Q: Why is AI alignment technology alone insufficient?**
A: AI alignment is a technical methodology to make systems behave as intended. However, societal consensus on 'what constitutes the right intent,' sanctions for violations, and stakeholder participation processes are inherently tasks for the legal and institutional domain.

**Q: What approach does South Korea's AI Basic Act take?**
A: South Korea's Artificial Intelligence Basic Act specifies 'high-impact AI' and mandates safety and reliability measures for it, introducing a framework similar to the EU's risk-based approach. This is an attempt to manage by prioritizing rather than regulating all AI.

## Conclusion

Discussions surrounding the future of AI often easily fall into technological determinism. However, as history shows, the trajectory of technology is deeply influenced by the rules and norms established by society. Entrusting everything to technical alignment in a state of legal vacuum may be replicating the ancient experiment of entrusting the complexities of governance to the hands of philosopher-kings in the digital age. What we need is a more humble and robust governance model that combines the wisdom of technology with the boundaries of law.
