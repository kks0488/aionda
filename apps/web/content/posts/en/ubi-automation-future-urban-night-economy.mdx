# UBI and Automation Transform the City's Night: The Future of the Nighttime Economy and Cityscapes

The experimental introduction of Universal Basic Income (UBI) and the accelerated automation of the service industry are reshaping our ways of working. The future at the intersection of these two major trends, particularly for the 24-hour nighttime economy and the urban nightscapes it weaves, remains unclear. The contraction of nighttime commercial activity goes beyond mere changes in economic indicators; it has the potential to fundamentally alter a city's cultural identity and visual landscape.

## Current Status: Data Revealing Changes in the Night

Analyses of UBI pilot experiments tend to focus on their overall impact on the labor market. Looking at the full results of large-scale experiments, a pattern emerges showing a decrease in labor market participation rates by approximately 2.0–3.9 percentage points and a reduction in average weekly working hours by 1.3–1.4 hours. While quantitative statistics specifically targeting nighttime service industry workers are difficult to isolate and publish separately, qualitative studies provide important clues about changes. For example, some UBI recipients have been observed transitioning away from precarious labor like night shifts to daytime full-time work or adjusting their family care schedules.

Meanwhile, the light that illuminates cities directly reflects the vitality of economic activity. The brightness of nighttime landscape lighting shows a strong positive correlation with commercial activity, with its luminance highest in central commercial districts. This light data has long been used as a proxy indicator for energy consumption, showing a high correlation coefficient with power usage ranging from 0.88 to 0.98. However, technological advancement is adding new variables to this relationship. With the transition to LEDs and the spread of smart control technology, cases are emerging where energy consumption is reduced by over 20% while maintaining the same commercial effect.

## Analysis: The Meaning of Structural Change

These facts reveal the complexity of the structural changes that UBI and automation could bring to the nighttime service industry. The economic safety net provided by UBI can broaden the range of choices for workers, especially those in poor working conditions. This could lead to pressure reducing the supply of nighttime service labor. Simultaneously, robots and automation systems are emerging as strong alternatives to fill this potential labor gap. Ultimately, the nighttime economy will find a new equilibrium point between labor cost burdens and the cost of adopting automation.

Changes in nighttime economic activity are directly linked to the physical appearance and cultural identity of the urban nightscape. If the neon signs of shops and restaurants and the lighting of bustling streets diminish, the city's night could become darker and more static. While this might be positive from an energy-saving perspective, it could also mean the decline of the nightscapes that form a city's vitality and tourist appeal. Technology has already shown ways to decouple energy consumption from the amount of light. Therefore, the future challenge will be how to preserve and recreate the social and cultural value of urban nightscapes even amidst the restructuring of economic activity.

## Practical Application: A Lens for Reading Change

Urban planners and policymakers must view the nighttime economy not merely as a space for consumption but as a complex social ecosystem. The qualitative data on labor mobility observed in UBI experiments can serve as important reference material for designing future nighttime worker protections and vocational training programs. Furthermore, real estate developers and merchants should consider how the adoption of automation goes beyond being a mere efficiency tool to reshape customer experience and the atmosphere of nighttime spaces.

From an energy management perspective, it is time to transform nighttime lighting data from a past indicator of economic activity into a new urban management tool integrated with smart control technology. By actively embracing the trend of 'decoupling' between lighting brightness and energy consumption, we can envision intelligent nighttime landscape systems where light is concentrated where it is needed.

## FAQ

**Q: If UBI is implemented, will everyone quit their night jobs?**
A: Large-scale UBI experiments show a slight decrease in overall labor participation rates, but not everyone stopped working. Instead, many recipients made choices to adjust their jobs for better working conditions or family circumstances. The specific impact on nighttime sectors will depend heavily on the local labor market and the availability of alternative jobs.

**Q: Does a darker city mean a worse economy?**
A: Historically, there has been a strong correlation between the brightness of nighttime lighting and economic activity. However, with advancements in LED and smart lighting technology, this relationship is gradually weakening. Therefore, a darker city with reduced energy consumption is not necessarily evidence of contracted economic activity. However, it could indicate a change in the spatial concentration of commercial activity.

**Q: Can automation replace all jobs in the nighttime service industry?**
A: Automation is likely to be introduced primarily around repetitive and predictable tasks. Therefore, while order-taking or simple cooking processes might be replaced, service elements requiring complex customer interaction or creativity will likely remain important human roles for the foreseeable future. It's more about a change in the quality and composition of jobs rather than just the quantity.

## Conclusion

UBI and automation are turning the urban nightscape into a complex projection plane intertwined with energy consumption, the labor market, and cultural identity. Change is a process of transition, not simple extinction. What we need is not to fear a darker city with diminished light, but to combine technology and policy to find a new nighttime equation where economic vitality, human value, and energy efficiency coexist. Whether the city's night is redefined not merely as a bright place but as a sustainable and livable one now depends on our choices.
