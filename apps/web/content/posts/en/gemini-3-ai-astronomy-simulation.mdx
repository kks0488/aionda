Questions that humanity has held for thousands of years while gazing at the night sky are beginning to be solved in mere minutes on silicon chips. Multimodal AI technology, spearheaded by Google's Gemini 3-class models, is evolving into a powerful 'digital telescope' that analyzes the distribution of dark matter and the structure of the early universe, changing the paradigm of astronomy. Astronomers are now completing tasks that would have taken decades through AI simulations in the time it takes to drink a cup of coffee.

## Why 560 Hours of Simulation Was Reduced to 36 Minutes

Astronomical observation is not merely the act of taking photographs. It requires the integration of visual data captured by telescopes, spectroscopic data revealing elemental compositions, and numerical simulations intertwined with complex physical laws. Previously, this work demanded enormous computational costs and time.

According to research findings, AI-based simulations have recorded speeds approximately 1,000 times faster than conventional numerical analysis methods. Tasks that previously required supercomputers to work for about 560 hours to run high-resolution cosmic simulations can now be shortened to around 36 minutes. This signifies more than just an increase in speed; it means an environment has been created where scientists can validate more hypotheses more frequently.

The technical core lies in GAN (Generative Adversarial Network)-based super-resolution technology and multimodal data alignment. AI has expanded the number of particles by up to 512 times while reducing computational costs to 1/10 of previous levels. In particular, Gemini 3-class models map telescope visual data and physical simulation values into a Common Representation Space to enhance consistency. Through this, they have entered a stage of real-time noise removal from all-sky survey data and precise inference of cosmological constants.

## ‘Thinking Tokens’ Verifying the Mysteries of the Universe

But can AI predictions be trusted implicitly? In the realm of science, 'hallucination' is fatal. To address this, Gemini 3-class models have introduced an inference process utilizing 'Internal Thinking Tokens.' Instead of simply producing a result, the AI reviews the intermediate process itself to ensure it does not violate physical laws before reaching a conclusion.

Verification protocols have become more rigorous. Following NASA's SDE (Science Discovery Engine) protocol, a 'Human-in-the-Loop' feedback loop operates where experts review and modify AI predictions. When analyzing dark matter distribution, data is cross-referenced with large-scale cosmological simulation data such as BAHAMAS-SIDM, and physical consistency across different modalities—such as X-rays and weak gravitational lensing—is checked.

Of course, limitations exist. Specific figures regarding how much AI has improved the performance of cosmological constant inference have not yet been reported to the academic community. Furthermore, detailed data regarding the potential loss of subtle astronomical signals during the real-time noise removal process or computational latency requires further confirmation.

## Changes in the Field: Astronomers Becoming Data Scientists

The required skills for astronomers are shifting from simply operating telescopes to refining data using large-scale AI models and physically interpreting the models' inference results.

Researchers can now build their own verification pipelines by referring to NASA's SDE protocol. It is possible to attempt multimodal learning by combining observational and physical simulation data using the Gemini API, or to increase the accuracy of AI models using open-source large-scale cosmic simulation data. In particular, utilizing AI's pattern recognition capabilities in the process of distinguishing dark matter from cosmic noise allows for the discovery of subtle structural features that were previously missed by the human eye.

## FAQ

**Q: What makes Gemini 3-class models different from previous models?**
A: They feature enhanced multimodal alignment capabilities for processing visual, spectroscopic, and numerical data in a single space. They are particularly optimized for logically analyzing complex physical simulation data and inferring cosmological constants through internal thinking tokens.

**Q: Is the accuracy of AI simulations reliable?**
A: While achieving speeds approximately 1,000 times faster, they undergo cross-validation with existing standard simulation data such as BAHAMAS-SIDM. However, data loss rates during real-time processing remain a research challenge.

**Q: Can general researchers use this technology immediately?**
A: Access is possible through open platforms like NASA's SDE or the Google Gemini API. However, since expert intervention (Human-in-the-Loop) is essential to verify physical consistency, it is recommended to use it as a collaborative tool rather than for independent use.

## Conclusion

AI has now become an indispensable core tool for tracing the origins of the universe. The 1,000-fold efficiency and multimodal alignment technology demonstrated by Gemini 3-class models are expected to be the keys to unlocking the mysteries of dark matter. Although precise analysis of inference improvement or data loss remains a challenge, the technical progress that has transformed hundreds of hours of waiting into dozens of minutes of insight has already created a massive trend. When this technology is combined with next-generation observation equipment like the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), humanity will begin to rewrite the map of the universe.
