## TL;DR
- GPTZero found false AI-generated citations in major conference papers.
- Peer review systems may fail to filter these hallucinations effectively.
- The academic community is considering new verification processes and reviewer standards.

## Current Status
GPTZero is an AI detection technology company.
It recently analyzed papers from major conferences like NeurIPS.
The investigation found fabricated literature in some reference lists.
These lists included non-existent authors, titles, and journal names.
Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate this through hallucinations.

Some papers containing this content passed peer review.
Reviewers often focus on logical structure and experimental results.
They may not cross-verify the existence of every reference.
AI-generated sentences have become more natural over time.
This makes it difficult for humans to identify machine intervention.

Academia currently views this as a research ethics violation.
Societies are preparing potential countermeasures.
Some require the disclosure of AI use during submission.
Anonymity in the review process may limit these controls.

## Analysis
This issue may stem from "Publish or Perish" culture.
Researchers might use AI to reduce writing time.
They may omit the process of verifying generated information.
Fake citations could spread misinformation if others cite them.
This could impact the entire academic community.

The peer review system has structural limitations.
Reviewers are experts who volunteer without compensation.
They often face high submission volumes with limited time.
AI-generated content can make human judgments more difficult.
Existing verification methods struggle to keep up with AI.

Discussions regarding AI detection tools are ongoing.
Tools like GPTZero can help find false citations.
Competition between AI models and detection tools will likely continue.
Some argue that detection scores alone cannot determine research ethics.
Institutional bases for these judgments remain limited.

## Practical Application
Stakeholders can consider several measures to maintain trust.

1. **Researchers**: They should manually check all AI-generated references. Databases like Google Scholar or DOI can be used. Verifying the actual existence of literature is necessary.
2. **Reviewers and Societies**: They can introduce automated bibliographic verification tools. Systems can check if citations match actual databases. This can increase verification accuracy.
3. **Institutional Improvements**: Guidelines can recommend submitting AI detection reports. Societies could impose sanctions if researchers find false citations.

## FAQ
**Q: Why do AI-generated fake citations occur?**
A: LLMs generate sentences based on word probabilities. They may combine names or titles to create non-existent information.

**Q: Why did human reviewers fail to discover this?**
A: Reviewers focus on methodology, originality, and results. Reference lists are long and can appear plausible.

**Q: Can the results of AI detection tools be trusted?**
A: These tools provide probabilities and can show false positives. They should serve as auxiliary screening tools. Experts should make the final judgment based on evidence.

## Conclusion
False citations found at NeurIPS suggest AI can impact reliability.
Unchecked hallucinations may reduce the credibility of academic papers.
Academia should use AI while establishing verification systems.
Enhanced ethical standards and technical supplements are needed.
Researchers should perform responsible inspections of their work.
