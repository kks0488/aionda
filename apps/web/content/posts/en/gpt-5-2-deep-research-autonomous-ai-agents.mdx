A market analysis report that used to take a junior analyst weeks to complete is now finalized in 20 minutes—the time it takes to drink a cup of coffee. This is not merely a summary of information. We have entered the era of 'Deep Research,' where AI independently scours hundreds of web sources, cross-references contradictory information, and self-corrects logical flaws. As of 2026, we stand at an inflection point where AI must be treated not as a tool, but as an 'autonomous research partner.'

The introduction of Deep Research and the GPT-5.2 Thinking models by OpenAI has completely dismantled the traditional chatbot paradigm. While AI in the era of legacy models like GPT-4 or Claude 3.5 was preoccupied with providing immediate answers to user queries, today's agents take 'time to think.' They consume reasoning tokens to establish goals and decompose complex tasks into dozens of sub-tasks. This is not just a matter of speed; it signifies that machines have begun to perfectly emulate 'System 2' thinking—the slow, deliberate, and logical reasoning process once considered a uniquely human domain.

## The End of the Junior Analyst and the Rise of Agents

Currently, OpenAI Deep Research records a 70.9% win rate against human experts in GDPval, a professional-level task benchmark. Notably, it achieved 26.6% accuracy on the high-difficulty benchmark known as 'Humanity's Last Exam,' a breathtaking leap from the 3.3% recorded by models just two years ago.

The economic impact is even more stark. Instead of hiring a junior analyst with an annual salary of $150,000, corporations can obtain equivalent or more sophisticated outputs for a $200 monthly subscription. By simple calculation, this is less than 1/60th of the labor cost. While Google’s Gemini 3 and Anthropic’s Claude Opus 4.5 are also clashing in this market, OpenAI maintains its lead in 'long-term planning' capabilities based on the reasoning foundations established since the o1 engine.

The core of Deep Research is an infinite loop of 'Search-Analysis-Synthesis.' Upon receiving an initial query, the agent immediately generates dozens of search paths. If information conflicts while exploring hundreds of sources on the web, the agent activates a 'Backtracking' mechanism. It adjusts its plan in real-time, judging for itself: "This source has low credibility; I must verify this through another path." This entire process is linked to verifiable citations, allowing users to track the AI's logical basis at any time.

## Technical Reality: Autonomy Driven by Reasoning Tokens

At the root of this autonomy lies a multi-step reasoning model based on Reinforcement Learning (RL). While previous models focused on probabilistic connections between words, the GPT-5.2 reasoning engine prioritizes 'goal alignment.' It is easy to lose sight of the original research objective when navigating hundreds of web pages, but Deep Research agents maintain consistency by monitoring a hierarchically structured list of sub-tasks in real-time.

However, the outlook is not entirely rosy. Some in the tech industry still raise concerns about 'Workslop'—logical errors that occur when AI-generated reports appear perfect on the surface but fail to distinguish rumors cleverly mixed with authoritative sources. Although self-correction mechanisms are suppressing hallucinations, success rates still vary in research involving extremely complex, uncharted territories. Furthermore, OpenAI keeps the specific operational methods of reasoning tokens and memory optimization algorithms as trade secrets, leaving the issue of technical transparency as a remaining challenge.

## Practical Application: What to Do Now?

Organizations and individuals must now move beyond using AI as a 'search bar.' Deep Research agents demonstrate overwhelming efficiency in the following scenarios:

1.  **Market Entry Strategy Development**: Draft a strategy report within 30 minutes by analyzing the regulatory environment, competitor status, and local consumer trends of a specific country using hundreds of local-language sources.
2.  **Technical Due Diligence**: Review security vulnerabilities in complex open-source libraries or the long-term maintainability of a specific tech stack based on tens of thousands of pages of documentation and community data.
3.  **Academic Research Assistance**: Scan thousands of papers to find evidence contradicting a specific hypothesis and suggest new experimental directions by identifying research gaps.

Users must now develop the ability to design 'complex missions' for agents rather than just learning how to 'ask questions.' Instead of simply saying, "Research the semiconductor market," the role of a 'Research Architect'—setting key metrics to analyze and prioritizing sources to reference—has become crucial.

## FAQ

**Q: How does a Deep Research agent differ from traditional RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)?**
**A:** Traditional RAG is limited to 'one-off' tasks of finding and summarizing relevant documents. In contrast, Deep Research is fundamentally different in that it performs a 'multi-step reasoning loop,' setting its own search plans, performing additional searches if information is lacking, and returning to previous steps to revise plans if contradictions are found.

**Q: How are the copyright and reliability of AI-generated reports guaranteed?**
**A:** Every sentence generated by Deep Research includes citations linked to the original sources. The structure allows users to verify reliability directly through these citations. However, regarding copyright issues, courts worldwide currently judge AI outputs based on the 'degree of human contribution.' Therefore, a process of final critical review and editing by a human based on the agent's results remains essential.

**Q: How much does it cost for a general user to use GPT-5.2-based Deep Research?**
**A:** It is currently offered at approximately $200 per month under OpenAI's ChatGPT Pro subscription model. While more expensive than general text generation models, it boasts overwhelming cost-effectiveness considering the hourly cost of professional research personnel.

## Conclusion: From Assistant to Partner

We have now moved past the era of 'Generative AI' and entered the era of 'Agentic AI.' The achievements shown by OpenAI Deep Research suggest that AI will no longer remain a mere auxiliary tool for humans. They think, plan, and correct their own mistakes.

The key point to watch moving forward is the explosive power that will be unleashed when these autonomous reasoning capabilities combine with specialized industry data. If Deep Research models specialized in medicine, law, and finance emerge, the structure of knowledge labor will be completely reorganized. The question must now shift from "Will AI replace humans?" to "Who will utilize these autonomous agents most intelligently?" The automation of high-end knowledge work has now become an unavoidable reality.
