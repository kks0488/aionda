A trader reviews an internal schedule that is not public. The trader then enters a prediction market. The position could be an event contract, not a stock. The discomfort can feel similar. The structure can reward inside information.

The core issue is simple. Employees at AI companies can profit from internal information. They can do so on prediction-market platforms. We then decide how far “insider trading” concepts extend. The company should also decide on controls. Controls can reduce recurrence. Controls can also support after-the-fact proof.

## TL;DR
- This reframes prediction-market employee betting using MNPI concepts, not only securities law language.  
- It matters because non-public, precise information can move market probabilities, and weak logs hinder investigations.  
- Next, define “precise” information, add pre-clearance windows, and treat key logs as audit events.  

Example: A staff member notices a change in internal metrics. They place a bet on an outside market. The public later learns the information. The market shifts, and the staff member profits. The team suspects something, but evidence is hard to collect.

## TL;DR
- We analyze how employees can use internal information for profits in prediction markets, using **MNPI/inside information** framing.
- Direct regulatory applicability may depend on whether **the contract is a financial instrument or security** in a jurisdiction. The frame of **non-public + materiality/price impact** can still map to internal controls.
- What to do: (1) grade internal information around **“precise” information**.

## Current state


The first gate remains legal classification. Legal coverage of prediction markets remains unsettled in this draft. The investigation results “as of the time of writing” do not yield a single answer. They do not cover all jurisdictions. It also depends on product structure. Many organizations start with internal rules anyway. They often focus on what to prohibit. They also focus on what to track.

## Analysis
This issue can feel sharper in AI settings. The “shape of information” can vary. Internal information is not only fixed financial tables. It can include model performance evaluations. It can include safety evaluations. It can include launch readiness. It can include partnership progress. It can include infrastructure readiness. Combined, these can change market pricing. Prediction markets commoditize future events. Internal schedules can interact with those contracts. Decision-making information can also interact.

Companies can avoid copying regulatory text verbatim. They can rewrite it for internal controls. MNPI rules can be the target. The core can have two parts.


Second, build an **audit trail** that can withstand disputes. CMS Audit and Accountability (AU) guidance lists essential log examples. It includes **access and authentication actions**. It includes **administrative changes**. It includes **security configuration adjustments**. These logs can support reconstruction. They can show when someone accessed which information.

Broad bans on employee participation can raise privacy concerns. They can also trigger internal pushback. Over-broad MNPI definitions can also slow operations. Vague “materiality” criteria can weaken policy. A blanket prohibition is not the only option. Risk-based controls can reduce burden. OECD compliance “good practice” materials discuss risk assessment. The same materials emphasize high-risk communications. They also mention conflicts of interest. They also mention reporting and response systems. Prediction-market betting can fit as a conflict of interest. Restrictions can then vary by role and information risk.

## Practical application

Technical controls often rely on logs. CMS AU examples include access and authentication. They also include administrative changes. They also include security configuration adjustments. These can be treated as minimum investigable events. The organization can also log view actions. It can log downloads. It can log permission changes. It can apply this across documents and dashboards. It can include experiment-tracking systems. The goal is “who, when, what” reconstruction. This can support investigations. Without it, enforcement can weaken. That can happen even with a betting prohibition clause.

**Checklist for Today:**
- Classify internal information using the “precise information” criterion, and mark high-impact categories as high risk.  
- Add prediction markets and event contracts to conflicts-of-interest policies, with pre-clearance or restricted windows for high-risk roles.  
- Log access and authentication, permission changes, configuration changes, and view or download events, with documented evidence handling.  

## FAQ
**Q1. Can betting in prediction markets also be punished as insider trading?**  
A1. The current investigation results do not support a single unified answer. Insider-trading rules often target regulated transactions. They often focus on securities or financial instruments. Whether prediction-market contracts qualify can vary by jurisdiction. It can also vary by product structure. Internal controls can still borrow MNPI concepts. Those include non-public information and materiality.

**Q2. How should a company define internal information (MNPI/inside information)?**  
The EU MAR definition of inside information includes that the information is of a precise nature, has not been made public, relates directly or indirectly to one or more issuers or financial instruments, and would be likely to have a significant effect on prices if made public.

**Q3. For “auditable controls,” how far should logging go?**  
A3. CMS AU guidance suggests recording core events. It lists access and authentication. It also lists administrative changes. It also lists security configuration adjustments. For prediction-market insider issues, the key is traceability. It should cover access to sensitive information stores. It should also cover permission changes and data exports.
