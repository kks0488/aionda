## TL;DR
- Prompt design strategies use Markdown, delimiters, and positive instructions for precise output control.
- These methods can reduce token costs, improve readability, and prevent model malfunctions.
- Users should place instructions at the top and define specific output formats.

Example: When users seek location information, the AI provides lengthy responses with weather greetings. Screens fill with extra information, making necessary details hard to find. The AI continues asking follow-up questions despite finished interactions, leading to user fatigue.

## Current Status
Placing instructions at the start of system messages improves response accuracy. Guidelines from January 29, 2026, suggest separating commands from data using symbols. Using delimiters like hashes or quotes focuses the model on key instructions. This approach helps reduce cases where the model ignores instructions.

Positive instructions define what the model should do rather than listing prohibited actions. Instructing the model to use simple terms for children yields better results than forbidding jargon.

Markdown improves readability through titles, bullet points, and bold text. Some strategies use backticks for persona details or closed sentences to end conversations. Establishing an information hierarchy can be helpful for consistency. These practical tips for non-verbal descriptions do not appear in official documentation yet.

## Analysis
System prompt design balances freedom and control. Clear structural constraints can provide consistent responses for business needs. Markdown and delimiters help the model predict the next token accurately.

Closing sentences can directly influence operating costs. AI follow-up questions may lead to extra conversations and more API calls. Completing a sentence with helpful closing remarks can prevent resource waste.

Controlling non-verbal expressions helps the persona but might affect readability. Isolating these thoughts with parentheses or backticks can prevent confusion. This serves as a safeguard against the model mixing roles with information.

## Practical Application
Developers and planners should approach prompt creation with a structural mindset. The core is to reduce natural language ambiguity. Providing visual cues helps the model interpret instructions.

**Checklist for Today:**
- Rewrite all negative commands in system prompts as positive instructions.
- Introduce delimiters to distinguish boundaries between commands and data.
- Define standard closing phrases for use when conversation conditions are met.

## FAQ
**Q: Can I use symbols other than triple hashes as delimiters?**
A: Yes. You can use clear symbols like triple quotes or dashes to mark transitions. Using them consistently helps the model perceive data boundaries.

**Q: Can positive instructions alone prevent negative behavior?**
A: Describing the desired alternative behavior in detail is often effective. Focusing on prohibited words might cause the model to use those very words.

**Q: Does Markdown structuring increase token usage?**
A: Markdown adds a few symbols but can reduce unnecessary sentences. Token efficiency often increases as response quality improves.

## Conclusion
The key to controlling Large Language Model behavior lies in understanding the model as a command engine. Prompt engineering in 2026 involves sophisticated designs with Markdown and delimiters.

One should note how these manual control techniques are merging with model fine-tuning or agent workflows. Improving system messages is an efficient way to boost performance. Organizations should consider building prompt libraries to verify these systems.
