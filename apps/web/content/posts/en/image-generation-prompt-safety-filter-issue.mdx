## TL;DR
- Non-English prompts often trigger safety filters incorrectly during internal translation processes.
- Linguistic disparities create unfair environments and reduce reliability for global users.
- Users should set system prompts to act as engineers and expand inputs into English.

Example: A person describes several youth playing in a park using a native tongue. The system immediately issues a policy warning and rejects the request. When that person translates the same sentence into a different language, the system creates a clear image.

## Current Status

Users might notice that multilingual image tools process prompts indirectly. Internal models often expand short inputs into longer English descriptions. Research suggests this expansion can change the original intent. Safety filters may misidentify non-English words as risks. Guidelines optimized for English can block ambiguous expressions. Complex token structures can lead to alignment errors. Models might select an incorrect meaning for a word. This often results in unexplained policy violation notices.

## Analysis

Internal cross-lingual conversion remains the primary cause of these errors. Visual datasets are mostly based on English descriptions. Non-English prompts follow a relay sequence that can distort information. Safety filters often react strictly to non-English inputs. If the model cannot determine the intent of a sentence, it may choose to block it. Low token comprehension can categorize a prompt as uncertain. This may limit creative autonomy for many global users. Over-correction during prompt expansion also contributes to rejections. Algorithms might add filtered keywords that the user rarely intended.

## Practical Application

Users can technically address these linguistic barriers. Defining the model role in the system prompt can help. Manual configuration of intermediary steps may provide better control.

**Checklist for Today:**
- Set system instructions to translate and expand non-English inputs into English descriptions.
- Define the AI as a professional prompt designer that follows safety policies.
- Request that the model analyze rejection reasons and suggest safe alternatives.

## FAQ

**Q: Is the low success rate when inputting only in Korean due to translation quality?**
A: Contextual alignment matters more than simple translation. Models might fail to find keywords linked to the visual dataset. They may also violate regulations while filling in omitted sentence components.

**Q: Can modifying the system prompt bypass security policies?**
A: Adjusting prompts aims to prevent malfunctions rather than bypass security. Legitimate prompts should pass while harmful content remains blocked.

**Q: Which is more advantageous: direct English input or automatic translation via system prompts?**
A: Direct English input can offer more precise control. Using system prompts for expansion is often more convenient for multilingual use.

## Conclusion

Performance gaps depend on how models connect context to visual data. Current rejections appear to be noise from cross-lingual alignment. Improving safety filters should help capture user intent more accurately. Language should be a tool for creation rather than a hurdle. Using system prompts can resolve these transitional issues effectively.
