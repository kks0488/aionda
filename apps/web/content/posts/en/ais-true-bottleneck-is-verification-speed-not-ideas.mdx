The bottleneck in AI advancement is not a lack of ideas. The real issue is the speed of verification. Łukasz Kaiser asserts that AI will be the one to solve this process.

## Rationale
Internal code at OpenAI and Google is a mess. Researchers neglect technical debt to prioritize producing results. Łukasz Kaiser’s notes contain a backlog of a hundred unverified ideas. Even when bugs occur during the training of large models, they push through without stopping.

GPUs and energy are the primary physical constraints. There is currently a shortage of small models optimized for experimentation. Research will accelerate when AI assists with refactoring and experimental preparation. Automating verification will transform seemingly stagnant progress into an explosion.

## Counterargument
Video data has extremely low information density. Unlike text, the majority of it consists of redundant pixel information. While essential for understanding the physical world, it is less critical for white-collar agents.

## FAQ
Q: Does synthetic data fundamentally change pre-training models?  
A: It is useful for improving reasoning models, but it is not yet at a revolutionary level.

Q: What stage are reasoning models like o1 currently in?  
A: they are in the early stages, having just reached the "first floor." There is vast potential for optimization, such as parallel reasoning.

Q: Is reaching AGI truly possible?  
A: It is possible if continuous learning and reasoning models are combined. It will meet Demis Hassabis's definition.

## Conclusion
Progress is incremental internally, but it appears as an explosion from the outside. Sam Altman continues to push forward, undeterred by criticism. Creating a paradise is the responsibility of humans, not tools. Start addressing your own technical debt with AI tools right now.
