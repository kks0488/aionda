## TL;DR
- AI affects around 60% of jobs in advanced economies, with half facing high displacement risk.
- These shifts could increase global GDP but may also cause wealth polarization and labor issues.
- Organizations should evaluate task exposure and create retraining plans for workers at risk.

Example: In a quiet office, software organizes complex analytical data in an instant. In a large warehouse, machines move goods like people do. This scene shows a shift in how we define work and money.

The proliferation of AI technology is changing the nature of work. We are witnessing productivity gains alongside structural crises in the labor market. Discussions are shifting from technical performance to methods of benefit distribution.

## Current Status
Approximately 40% of global employment is directly affected by AI. The IMF reports this figure reaches 60% in advanced economies. Half of these jobs could see productivity gains. The other half may face job instability as AI replaces tasks.


Humanoid robot technology has emerged as an economic variable. Automation is spreading to manufacturing as AI integrates with robotic hardware. Specific productivity figures for these robots are still in the verification stage.

## Analysis
AI-driven economic changes present challenges for both growth and distribution. Wealth polarization could deepen if gains stay with technology owners. Projected GDP growth could become a shared asset for humanity. In unprepared societies, it risks creating class conflict.

Social safety nets may not support the pace of AI proliferation. Low-skilled workers often adapt slower than the rate of automation. Even high-skilled fields show signs of labor market fragmentation. This divides workers into those who benefit and those who are marginalized.

## Practical Application
Companies and policymakers should consider efficiency and human resource reallocation. Automation focused only on costs could reduce long-term consumption power. This may exert downward pressure on the overall economy.

Example: A company can reassign staff to audit ethical judgments when introducing AI to customer service.

**Checklist for Today:**
- Audit work processes to classify tasks as replaceable or enhanced by AI.
- Allocate a portion of automation savings to employee retraining programs.
- Track the AI Preparedness Index to anticipate upcoming policy changes.

## FAQ
**Q: How likely is it that AI will eliminate my job?**
Analysis suggests 30% of jobs in advanced economies are at high risk. Other roles may see productivity increases through collaboration with AI. You should evaluate if your duties focus on data processing or decision-making.

**Q: When will the economic growth benefits of AI be felt?**

**Q: What is the impact of combining robots and AI?**
This combination accelerates the automation of physical and knowledge work. It will drive productivity but may create entry barriers for low-skilled labor.

## Conclusion
AI and robotics bring productivity gains but also wealth concentration risks. Data shows we face a choice between unemployment and resource redistribution. Governments should consider how to return excess profits to the social system. Institutional improvements will likely determine the direction of the global economy after 2026.
