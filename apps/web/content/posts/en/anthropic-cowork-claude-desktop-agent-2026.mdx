Anthropic unveiled Cowork on January 12. Built into the Claude Desktop app, this feature lets AI read, modify, and create local files without any coding knowledge. The era of delegating work to AI "like leaving messages for a coworker" has arrived.

## What Is Cowork?

Cowork is an AI agent embedded in the Claude Desktop app. Claude autonomously performs file operations within a user-designated folder.

**Core Features:**
- Read, modify, and create files
- Process multiple tasks simultaneously
- Self-verify and ask questions when stuck

While Claude Code was a terminal tool for developers, Cowork is the desktop version for general users.

## Use Cases

Representative examples provided by Anthropic:

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Downloads folder cleanup | Sort files and intelligently rename them |
| Receipt analysis | Extract expenses from screenshots into spreadsheets |
| Document drafting | Compile information from scattered notes into reports |
| Data cleanup | Refine and structure CSV files |

The key is **autonomous execution**. Rather than simply generating text, it plans → executes step by step → self-verifies → asks questions when stuck.

## Built in 10 Days

Cowork's development time was just 10 days.

Claude Code, released in late 2024, became a hit among developers. But according to Anthropic engineer Boris Cherny, an interesting phenomenon emerged: users were **using the coding tool for non-coding tasks**.

"We observed users deploying Claude Code for file organization, email drafts, and spreadsheet work. Rather than restricting this behavior, we decided to build a dedicated product."

Cowork was completed in the last week and a half.

## How to Use It

1. Install Claude Desktop app (macOS)
2. Designate a working folder (sandbox)
3. Give instructions via chat
4. Claude executes autonomously

Queue multiple tasks and Claude processes them simultaneously. Anthropic describes it as "feeling much less like a back-and-forth and much more like leaving messages for a coworker."

## Availability and Limitations

**Currently Available:**
- Claude Max subscribers only
- macOS only (Windows planned)
- Research Preview stage

**Waitlist:**
Pro and other plan users can register for the waitlist.

## Safety Warnings

Anthropic officially warned about several risk factors.

**Security Risks:**
- Potential for prompt injection attacks
- File deletion permissions
- Unexpected behavior with vague instructions

**Recommendations:**
- Make instructions as clear as possible
- Back up important files before work
- Don't designate folders containing sensitive information

## Claude Code vs Cowork

| Item | Claude Code | Cowork |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Target | Developers | General users |
| Interface | Terminal | GUI chat |
| Scope | Code writing/editing | File management/documents |
| Technical requirement | High | Low |

## FAQ

**Q: Can I use it for free?**

A: Currently only available to Claude Max subscribers. Other plans can register for the waitlist.

**Q: Does it work on Windows?**

A: Only macOS is supported now. Windows version is planned for future release.

**Q: Are files uploaded to the cloud?**

A: Cowork operates on local folders. However, some data may be sent to Anthropic servers for AI processing, so caution is needed when working with sensitive files.

## Conclusion

Cowork is a product that accelerates the democratization of AI agents. Office workers without coding knowledge can now delegate repetitive tasks to AI.

Of course, it's still a Research Preview. Risk factors like file deletion permissions exist. But the direction is clear. AI is evolving beyond simple chatbots into **a coworker that actually gets work done**.

"We observed what Claude Code users wanted and built a new product in 10 days." Anthropic's agility demonstrates the pace of the AI industry.
