## TL;DR
- In January 2026, Sora app downloads and revenue decreased by 45% and 32% month-over-month, respectively, indicating a loss of initial growth momentum.
- High-cost inference structures and a lack of inter-frame consistency are serving as major obstacles to adoption in professional video production fields.
- Users should verify efficiency against actual costs by considering the probability of generation failure and should prioritize the use of partially optimized features.

Example: A video producer enters prompts to create a person walking. However, the legs of the person on screen blend with the background or twist unnaturally. Eventually, the producer cancels their paid subscription and returns to the video sites they previously used.

## Current Status
The Sora app has entered a downward trend following its initial growth phase. As of January 2026, app downloads fell by 45% compared to the previous month, and revenue—representing consumer spending—also dropped by 32%. This suggests that initial curiosity regarding AI video technology is not sufficiently translating into actual payments and long-term usage.


Technical maturity remains a challenge as well. Issues such as broken consistency between frames or unnatural visual flow frequently occur in generated videos. According to research published on arXiv, existing text-to-video generation methods struggle with precise control and adherence to physical laws. This makes it difficult for professional production environments to use Sora as a replacement tool rather than just a supplementary aid.

## Analysis
The decline in metrics shows that video generation technology has yet to secure Product-Market Fit (PMF). Under the current structure, it is difficult to escape a negative margin situation where the computational costs of video generation exceed subscription fees. This limits the ability of service providers to enhance features or lower prices.

Technically, the lack of "temporal consistency" is a significant problem. Video is a continuous flow, not just a collection of single images. The flickering or sudden disappearance of objects commonly seen in Sora-generated videos are factors that make it difficult for professional creators to trust this technology. A structure where users should repeat generation multiple times to get a desired result, despite paying high costs, reduces its value as a productivity tool.

In the future, the market is expected to bifurcate. Large-scale studios that can afford high costs will prefer models capable of sophisticated control, while the general public will seek cheaper models even if performance is lower. Sora's current situation is interpreted as a result of failing to secure a clear position between these market segments.

## Practical Application
Companies or individuals seeking to introduce AI into their video production processes should coolly assess efficiency. Priority should be given to identifying the average number of generations required to obtain a final result and the resulting cumulative costs, rather than the novelty of the technology itself.

**Things to do today:**
- Calculate the unit price per cut for videos currently in production and compare it with costs including the probability of AI generation failure.
- Limit usage to abstract backgrounds or motion graphics with wider visual tolerances.
Rather than live-action videos where adherence to physical laws is essential.
- Prioritize the adoption of proven partial optimization features, such as upscaling existing video resolution or expanding backgrounds, rather than full video generation.

## FAQ
**Q: Is the decline in Sora's metrics due to competing models?**
A: While there is an impact from competitors, high inference costs and technical instability are cited as more direct causes. Analysis suggests the entire market has hit the economic limits of video generation.

**Q: Is there any possibility that inference costs will decrease in the future?**
A: While cost reductions through hardware improvements are being attempted, it is uncertain whether they will drop to a mass-market level within the first half of 2026. Currently, resources are trending toward increasing model intelligence and consistency rather than cost reduction.

**Q: Will creators stop using Sora?**
A: Rather than abandonment, a shift in purpose is likely. This is because the tool remains useful for quickly visualizing ideas during the planning stage, even if not for creating final outputs. However, it remains to be seen whether the willingness to pay for this will maintain current subscription price levels.

## Conclusion
The decline in the Sora app's metrics signifies that the AI industry has moved past the stage of technical wonder and into the stage of economic survival. If cost barriers and technical limitations are not overcome, video generation technology risks remaining a specialized tool for niche fields. Moving forward, securing cost-efficient inference and consistency will be key to market settlement rather than technical flashiness. Companies should carefully weigh the extent of productivity improvement against actual operating costs when adopting these technologies.
