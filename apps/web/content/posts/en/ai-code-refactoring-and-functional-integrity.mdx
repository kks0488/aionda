## TL;DR
* GPT 5.2 xhigh, Claude Opus 4.5, and Gemini 3 Pro provide new refactoring tools.
* These models maintain complex system architectures while reducing logic errors and security risks.
* Developers should divide code into logical units and choose appropriate model settings for verification.

Example: A software engineer provides old code to an assistant. The tool returns a clean version quickly. However, the system fails during a test run. The assistant removed a vital part for handling unusual errors.

Moving large amounts of old code to new frameworks creates heavy workloads. AI models can handle many repetitive tasks. These tools now focus on optimizing code while keeping original logic intact. Refactoring is now a primary focus of technical competition.

*   **Core of the Change**: GPT 5.2 xhigh, Claude Opus 4.5, and Gemini 3 Pro maintain functional integrity in large systems.
*   **Importance**: Information loss during refactoring causes security risks or logical errors.
*   **Execution Guide**: Divide complex code into units and build a verification process suited to your specific purpose.

## Current Status: Competition in Deep Reasoning and Wide Context
GPT 5.2 includes high-performance reasoning and information compression features. These features improve the accuracy of software refactoring. On December 11, 2025, this model reached 80% on SWE-bench Verified. It also scored 55.6% on SWE-bench Pro for solving engineering problems.

Other models offer specific strengths. Claude Opus 4.5 focuses on maintaining links between functions across multiple files. Gemini 3 Pro utilizes an expanded context window significantly larger than previous versions to support large codebases. This helps the model process long code without losing track of details. Enterprises are currently focusing on improving architecture while keeping business rules. They achieve this by connecting these models to development environments.

## Analysis: Causes of Information Loss and Countermeasures
AI refactoring can sometimes lack logical consistency. Models might delete important logic to gain efficiency. Often, these deleted parts include vital exception handling. GPT 5.2 xhigh uses advanced analysis to address these issues.

Research results show this model recorded scores between 92.4% and 93.2% on the GPQA Diamond benchmark. This indicates an ability to follow complex instructions. Information compression technology helps maintain core logic in long workflows. Technical limits still exist for all models. Large windows like Gemini 3 Pro may still miss middle information. Developers should choose a model based on specific project needs. You should balance a model's intelligence and its context retention capabilities.

## Practical Application: Safe Refactoring Strategies
Avoid expecting perfect results from a single AI request. Modifying many lines at once carries high risks. Breaking code into logical units is a more effective strategy. Verify functional equivalence at every single step. Use Retrieval-Augmented Generation to provide only relevant details. This can help reduce the loss of important information.

## Practical Application
**Checklist for Today:**
* Write unit tests to confirm that functionality remains the same after changes.
* Enable high reasoning modes when you modify complex logic.
* Use models with wide context windows for projects involving many files.

## FAQ
**Q: Is the performance of code refactored by the model reliable?**
A: GPT 5.2 xhigh scored 40.3% on FrontierMath for reasoning. Actual performance in your environment may vary. You should measure results using specific profiling tools.

**Q: How can I prevent information loss when inputting long code files?**
A: Divide code into smaller function units before input. Use models that offer features for information compression. Ask the model to summarize logic before it suggests changes.

**Q: Is there a possibility of security vulnerabilities occurring during the refactoring process?**
A: Simplifying code can accidentally remove security checks. Refactored code should undergo security inspections through static analysis tools.

## Conclusion
AI refactoring is moving toward full system redesign. Recent test scores show AI can handle engineering tasks. Success depends on integrating these tools into workflows. Real-time feedback helps ensure the code remains correct. The main value is preserving the original intent of the code.
