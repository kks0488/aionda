## TL;DR

- Regulatory and guidance texts often focus on evidence artifacts you should record, document, disclose, and verify.  
- Missing evidence can slow responses, especially for under age 14 consent, automated decision logs, and safeguards.  
- Convert requirements into deliverables, then confirm Korea-specific AI-only obligations using primary source text.

Teams often face an audit-style question after a product change ships.  
The question is usually, “Can we show evidence for this decision?”  
That gap can waste time during product meetings.  
It can also blur the boundary between reading and shipping deliverables.  

Example: A service evaluates a user request and limits what the user can do. The operator later asks why the outcome occurred. The team searches for prior inputs and system context. The records are incomplete, so the explanation stays uncertain.

This post groups “read only the essentials” into two buckets.  
The first bucket uses requirements confirmed as primary grounds via search results.  
It focuses on the personal data domain.  
The second bucket tracks recurring evidence points in AI Act materials.  
It focuses on automated decision-making and high-risk patterns.  

This research did not confirm Korea “AI-only” obligations via primary sources.  
Examples include AI risk assessment duties or output labeling duties.  
Those items remain pending further verification.

## Current state

A “read it end to end” approach can expand timelines and discussion scope.  
A pragmatic approach can be summarized in three parts.  

First, start with personal data processing requirements grounded in domestic law.  
The Ministry of Government Legislation guidance classifies safeguards into three types.  
They are administrative, technical, and physical measures.  
It also lists examples, like internal plans and access control.  
This structure can map to product and operations deliverables.  

Second, treat automated decision-making as evidence-heavy by default.  
Examples include recommendations, screening, blocking, or scoring.  
This research did not confirm Korea-specific AI-only primary text.  
Still, AI Act materials repeat several evidence themes for high-risk systems.  
They include dataset quality and minimizing discrimination risk.  
They include activity logging for traceability.  
They include detailed documentation about the system.  
AI Act Service Desk Article 15 mentions accuracy, robustness, and cybersecurity.  
It also mentions consistent performance throughout the lifecycle.  

Third, for minors, consent and verification usually come before explanations.  
You should obtain legal representative consent.  
You should verify whether consent was obtained.  
You should provide notices that are easy for a child to understand.  
This affects UI, signup flows, and consent record design.

## Analysis

Regulatory work often centers on later reconstruction.  
That means explaining what decisions were made and what data supported them.  
So the key sentences often involve record, document, disclose, and verify.  
Those verbs connect more directly to deliverables.  

When automated decisions affect rights or opportunities, AI Act materials repeat a bundle.  
The bundle includes activity logging for traceability.  
It includes design and purpose documentation for explainability.  
It includes accuracy, robustness, and cybersecurity evidence.  
These elements often move together during incident reviews.  
They help reconstruct what happened when questions arise later.  

This approach has limits.  

- First, this research could not confirm domestic AI risk assessment duties at article level.  
  A claim of unconditional obligation could create internal confusion.  
- Second, sensitive information may trigger higher-risk treatment in some regimes.  
  Search results here did not confirm domestic wording details.  
  Examples include separate consent, restrictions, or safeguard levels.  

In conclusion, treat three areas as likely to add requirements.  
They are sensitive information, automated decision-making, and minors under age 14.  
Design conservatively and validate obligations with primary source text.

## Practical application

Read “only the essentials” by asking evidence questions first.  

- What data do we collect, for what purpose, for how long, and under what access controls?  
- Does the model or rule classify or block a user status?  
  If yes, do we retain activity logs that can reproduce the outcome later?  
- Could a user be a minor?  
  If yes, do we branch for under age 14 and retain consent verification records?  

**Checklist for Today:**  
- Draft a one-page data flow and document purpose, retention, and access rights.  
- If automated decisions exist, define logging and documentation needed for traceability.  
- If minors are possible, add under age 14 consent flows and consent verification records.

## FAQ

**Q1. Isn’t it risky not to read all “domestic AI regulation/guidance”?**  
A1. This does not argue against legal review.  
It suggests starting with evidence deliverables that speed responses.  
Examples include processing purpose, retention, access rights, and consent records.  
Unverified domestic AI-only duties still need additional verification.  
That verification should rely on primary source text.  

**Q2. For automated decision-making, how much “logging” should we keep?**  
A2. AI Act-related materials emphasize traceability of outcomes.  
Aim for logs that reconstruct inputs and system state tied to results.  
Field scope, retention period, and access should be confirmed via primary sources.  
They should also align with personal data and security requirements.  

**Q3. What changes if we use sensitive information?**  
A3. Search results suggest sensitive data can raise risk in some regimes.  
Some uses may also be prohibited in some regimes.  
Start by clarifying purpose, scope, and likely risk classification.  
Domestic details were not confirmed by this research alone.  
Primary-source verification should happen before real application.

## Conclusion

Reading regulatory documents in full is not the main deliverable.  
Evidence-ready artifacts often matter more in audits and incident response.  
Focus first on recordable data flows, automated decision traceability, and minor consent evidence.  
Then validate Korea-specific AI-only obligations with primary source text.
