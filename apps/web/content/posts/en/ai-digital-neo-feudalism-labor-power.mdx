## TL;DR
- Artificial intelligence is shifting wealth from labor toward algorithmic ownership and impacting high-skilled roles.
- This concentration of data power can undermine social fairness and traditional merit-based reward systems.
- Organizations should audit their AI systems against international standards and redesign roles facing high automation risks.

Example: When preparing a complex legal brief or a set of computer instructions, the quality often depends on a specific tool. Individual expertise can become less visible as the software performs the core tasks. The person using the service might find their own skills overshadowed by the capabilities of the platform.

Traditional rewards for effort are changing. Artificial intelligence can replace intellectual expertise with fast data processing. The source of wealth is shifting from labor to algorithmic ownership. Some describe this as a form of digital feudalism. Transnational platforms can gain more influence than individual nations through data dominance.

## Current Status: The Era Where Data Overwhelms Capital
High-skilled knowledge labor now faces significant influence from technology. Approximately 27% of all jobs face high automation risks. The IMF forecasts that AI will affect 40% of jobs worldwide. In advanced economies, this figure can reach 60%. This shift involves complex tasks rather than just simple repetition. 

Actual economic indicators show these changes. The ILO notes that automation contributed to a decline in the global labor income share. Wealth is likely concentrating into capital holding algorithmic assets. 


## Analysis: Digital Lords and Algorithmic Fiefs
Digital structures may mirror historical systems by replacing land with data. Transnational corporations can exercise governing power through large language models. This structural change presents two possibilities. 

First, inequality might deepen. Society could split into those who own algorithms and those who perform simple tasks. Second, technology could mitigate productivity gaps. Research from the OECD suggests AI can assist low performers within an occupation. The core issue is whether technology leads to general growth or reinforces the top one percent. 

Technological transparency is vital. Standards such as IEEE 7001-2021 provide transparency frameworks that help determine if algorithms act as fair tools.

## Practical Application: Responding to Algorithmic Governance
Organizations should treat AI as a variable that changes governance. Opaque decision-making can reduce trust among internal members. It can also make a company a target for external regulation.

**Checklist for Today:**
- Evaluate if internal AI services meet transparency requirements found in ISO/IEC 42001.
- Review positions with high automation potential to prepare for future staff transitions.
- Create formal steps for human staff to check and correct any automated results.

## FAQ
**Q: Will AI necessarily deepen income inequality?**
A: Reports from the IMF and ILO suggest this risk. However, some OECD studies show it could help lower-skilled workers. Social policies will likely determine the final outcome.

**Q: What is the role of the state in the era of Digital Neo-Feudalism?**
A: The state can act as a mediator by setting standards. The EU AI Act is an example of this authority. Competition for sovereignty between states and corporations will likely continue.

**Q: Do standards like IEEE 7001-2021 have practical significance in the field?**
A: This standard provides ways to measure the transparency of autonomous systems. It serves as a basis for determining liability or monitoring bias.

## Conclusion
AI progress suggests a shift in how society values human labor. Data power appears to be concentrating in fewer hands. Moving forward, the legitimacy of algorithmic decisions is important. Managing these systems transparently can help define our relationship with technology.
