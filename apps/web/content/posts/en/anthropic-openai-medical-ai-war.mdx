The dream of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is moving beyond the living room and into the clinic. Silicon Valley giants such as Anthropic and OpenAI have begun a head-to-head confrontation in the 'Vertical AI' market, specializing in healthcare environments where human lives are at stake, moving beyond AI that simply writes well. AI has evolved from a general conversational partner into a specialized medical assistant that analyzes patient charts and reads brain signals, entering a war for market share.

## Specialization of Large Models: Claude 4.5 and Unified Medical Memory

In January 2026, Anthropic declared war by launching 'Claude for healthcare,' targeting the medical and life sciences sectors. This model is based on Claude 4.5, and its technical core lies in supporting HIPAA-compliant infrastructure and the execution of Business Associate Agreements (BAAs). This signifies that the legal and technical foundations have been laid for AI to directly process sensitive Protected Health Information (PHI).

To suppress hallucinations, Anthropic applied its 'Constitutional AI' framework. Furthermore, it enhanced data processing sophistication by integrating native connectors for specialized medical databases, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10), and PubMed. It also specifically addressed compatibility issues with existing hospital systems by supporting the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard.

OpenAI responded through an acquisition. During the same period, OpenAI acquired Torch, a medical data integration startup, for an amount between approximately $60 million and $100 million. The purpose of this acquisition is clear: to build a 'Unified Medical Memory' from fragmented medical records, test results, and wearable device data across different hospitals. Based on this, OpenAI is strengthening its personalized service, 'ChatGPT Health.' It functions as a personal assistant that provides diet or exercise prescriptions through multimodal reasoning capabilities that analyze biometric data as well as clinical transcriptions.

## Technology Beyond Noise: Automating Records by Reading Brain Signals

Attempts to solve the chronic problem of documentation overload in clinics are occurring at a more fundamental level. MergeLabs, invested in by Sam Altman, is directly overcoming the limitations of existing Speech-to-Text (STT) technology.

Existing microphone-based medical recording solutions showed an error rate of over 5% in environments with ambient noise or multiple people speaking simultaneously. In contrast, MergeLabs utilizes Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) technology to directly convert brain signals into speech or text. This aims for a 'human-AI fusion' model that accurately records a clinician's intentions regardless of the physical noise environment. However, while existing specialized solutions like S10.AI emphasize 99% accuracy, the extent to which MergeLabs' BCI technology will perform in actual clinical settings remains in the demonstration stage.

## The Weight of Data and the Barrier of Hallucinations

Despite the aggressive moves of Big Tech, technical and regulatory challenges remain significant. The biggest challenge is accuracy. Although Anthropic has put hallucination suppression technology at the forefront, detailed specifications on the specific technical training methods used to achieve this have not been publicly disclosed.

Furthermore, the 'Unified Medical Memory' OpenAI intends to build is directly linked to data privacy. Security vulnerabilities and data ownership issues that may arise during the process of consolidating data from different institutions are obstacles to commercialization. In particular, it has not yet been confirmed to what extent these models can comply with medical regulations outside the United States, such as South Korea's K-HIPAA.

From a critical perspective, MergeLabs' BCI technology also has a long way to go before mass adoption. The invasiveness of hardware for brain signal extraction, user convenience, and the lack of specialized performance data for non-English medical terminology (such as Korean) suggest that this technology is unlikely to replace the keyboard and mouse immediately.

## Practical Guide for Implementing Healthcare AI

What should physicians operating hospitals or medical IT developers prepare for right now?

First, data standardization is key. It is a priority to understand the FHIR standard supported by Anthropic's Claude 4.5 and organize hospital data according to those specifications. This is a core strategy to minimize transition costs regardless of which vertical model is adopted in the future.

Second, a step-by-step implementation scenario must be established. Rather than deploying AI directly into diagnostics, it is more realistic to start with the automation of clinical and administrative workflows proposed by Anthropic. For example, using Claude for healthcare's native connectors to link with specialized databases for simple appointment management or repetitive chart entry assistance.

Third, a hybrid approach should be considered. Utilize OpenAI's Unified Medical Memory functions to analyze a patient's wearable data, but design a double-check process where the final judgment is reviewed against existing, verified specialized solutions.

## FAQ

**Q: Can't we just use existing models like GPT-4 in medical settings?**
A: It is not impossible, but it is risky. General-purpose models do not guarantee HIPAA compliance, which could lead to legal liability in the event of a PHI (sensitive information) leak. Furthermore, the lack of direct integration with specialized medical databases increases the likelihood of hallucinations. The dedicated model, Claude for healthcare, is designed to reduce these legal and technical risks.

**Q: Is the technology from Torch, acquired by OpenAI, available to general ChatGPT users?**
A: OpenAI is strengthening this as a separate specialized service called 'ChatGPT Health.' It is expected to be provided in a form that offers precise, personalized advice to users who have the authority to integrate their personal medical records and wearable data.

**Q: Can MergeLabs' BCI technology be used immediately in Korean hospitals?**
A: It is difficult at this time. MergeLabs' technology is being developed primarily based on large-scale investments within the U.S., and its specialized performance for Korean medical terminology or compliance with domestic medical laws has not been confirmed. It is currently appropriate to view it as being in the technical demonstration stage.

## Conclusion: The Winner of Vertical AI Will Be Decided by 'Accuracy'

The competition in the AI healthcare market has shifted from 'who is smarter' to 'who is more accurate and safe.' Anthropic emphasizes regulatory compliance and hallucination suppression, OpenAI focuses on the integration of fragmented data, and MergeLabs highlights fundamental innovation in input methods.

The key point to watch moving forward is whether these models can consistently maintain an accuracy of 99% or higher in actual clinical settings. What matters more than technical specifications is how much AI can reduce errors in data directly related to a patient's life. 2026, where Big Tech capital meets startup specialization, will be the inaugural year for medical AI to move out of the 'lab' and establish itself as a protagonist in the 'clinic.'
