## TL;DR
- To combat state-level surveillance, device analysis and network traffic tracking have become core elements of digital forensics.
- By 2026, climate technology has entered a stage where it should prove tangible carbon reduction and energy efficiency beyond symbolic slogans.

Example: A man leaves all his electronic equipment at his residence and boards a plane. Upon arriving at his destination, he acquires a new device using untraceable cash and begins his communications.

## Current Status
The actions of security expert Ronald Deibert reflect the threats currently facing the security industry. In April 2025, he traveled to Illinois, leaving all his electronic devices at his home in Toronto. This is a physical blocking strategy based on the premise of device contamination, going beyond standard security hardening. Current spyware utilizes 'zero-click' methods to infect devices without any user interaction, hiding deep within the operating system.



## Analysis
The confrontation between digital forensics and spyware displays an asymmetric structure. Spyware developers backed by state agencies invest large budgets to discover vulnerabilities. In contrast, security experts often rely on post-incident analysis. Deibert's method of purchasing new devices suggests that current software security solutions may not sufficiently defend against state-level attacks.

Climate technology faces similar challenges. Even when new technologies emerge, the economic cost of replacing existing fossil fuel-based infrastructure remains high. The reason climate tech in 2026 focuses on energy efficiency is that it can induce corporate participation through immediate cost savings. Adoption speed and scalability have emerged as variables just as important as technical performance.

## Practical Application
Users and corporate security managers should re-evaluate their defense strategies. Hardware-level isolation should be considered when performing critical tasks. Regarding climate response, it is necessary to eliminate waste by monitoring power consumption in real-time.

**To-do list for today:**
- Power off and physically isolate any mobile devices showing suspicious signs, then request a professional forensic investigation.
- Check the carbon emission metrics of your current cloud and server infrastructure and review low-power mode settings.
- Delete apps with unnecessary permissions from work devices and activate enhanced security settings such as 'Lockdown Mode'.

## FAQ
**Q: Should ordinary people also replace their devices like Ronald Deibert?**
A: Not every user is a target. However, for specific professions such as politicians, journalists, and human rights activists, state-level spyware poses a realistic threat. General users can defend against common attacks by immediately applying operating system updates.

**Q: Which areas of climate technology are producing practical results in 2026?**
A: Demand management technologies, such as recovering waste heat from industrial processes or using AI to optimize building energy consumption, are showing significant results.

**Q: Is there a way for individuals to check for spyware infection?**
A: There is no definitive method, but one should closely monitor abnormal device heating, sudden increases in data usage, or frequent activation of camera and microphone indicator lights.

## Conclusion
Digital security and the climate crisis are major challenges facing humanity. Ronald Deibert's case warns that technology can be utilized as a tool for surveillance. Conversely, the evolution of climate tech demonstrates that technology can be a tool for solving environmental issues. We should remain vigilant against the risks hidden behind technological convenience while continuing technical efforts to overcome carbon emission limits. This is a time when the coexistence of transparent surveillance response systems and efficient energy technologies is required.
