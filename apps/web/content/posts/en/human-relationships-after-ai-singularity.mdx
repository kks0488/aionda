# After the Singularity, Why Will We Need Each Other?

If a future arrives where artificial intelligence resolves all emotional and practical deficiencies, the very essence of human relationships will be fundamentally shaken. Traditionally, love and bonds stemmed from mutual need fulfillment. But when technology can satisfy all needs individually, what will be the motivation to maintain relationships? This paradigm shift from deficiency-based to fulfillment-based relationships will redefine what we call 'connection.'

## Current Status: The Domains of Relationships Invaded by Technology

Research suggests that the effortless emotional satisfaction provided by technology risks distorting expectations of real human relationships. A study from Brigham Young University defines the emotional satisfaction created by AI companions as 'counterfeit connection.' Such connections can form unrealistic expectations about the mutual effort and compromise required in real relationships, ultimately undermining interpersonal satisfaction. Empirical data already exists showing that current technological interference phenomena increase conflict within interpersonal relationships and exacerbate emotional isolation.

Psychology's Self-Determination Theory explains that three basic psychological needs—autonomy, competence, and relatedness—are crucial for human well-being. Among these, the fulfillment of the need for relatedness has been identified as the strongest predictor of relationship satisfaction and individual well-being. Empirical research supports the fact that acts that fulfill others' basic psychological needs, particularly interpersonal emotion regulation, show a positive correlation with social network formation and increased popularity.

## Analysis: What Will Relationships Look Like After Fulfillment?

The difference in emotional quality between digitally-mediated relationships and face-to-face relationships provides important clues for envisioning the future. Face-to-face interaction remains the 'gold standard' in terms of emotional intimacy and empathy levels, thanks to nonverbal cues and biological hormonal responses. While digitally-mediated relationships have the potential to reach levels of intimacy comparable to face-to-face interactions given sufficient time and communication, they generally record lower levels in overall satisfaction and immersion.

This foreshadows the dilemma human relationships will face in a post-singularity world. If AI can efficiently fulfill the need for relatedness, humans may no longer form relationships 'out of necessity.' Then, the motivation for relationships must shift to new dimensions, such as pure curiosity, shared creativity, or simple confirmation of existence. Amid the convenience of effortless fulfillment provided by technology, the reason to willingly endure the complex process of understanding and attuning to another's needs may disappear.

## Practical Application: Relationship Skills for Preparing for the Future

Amid this wave of change, there are several principles individuals can practice to preserve the essence of relationships. First, recognize the difference between interactions through technological mediation and face-to-face interactions, and consciously prioritize face-to-face time for important emotional exchanges. Second, practice redefining relationships not merely as tools for need fulfillment but as arenas for collaboration for mutual growth. This includes developing the ability for interpersonal emotion regulation—active attempts to fulfill the other person's basic psychological needs.

## FAQ

**Q: If AI provides all conversation and comfort, will human friends or lovers truly become unnecessary?**
A: Current psychological research points out that fulfilling the need for relatedness is crucial for human well-being. While AI may fulfill this need to some extent, it is questionable whether it can completely replace the biological and emotional complexity and mutual growth arising from face-to-face relationships. Some study results also indicate that AI companions risk forming unrealistic expectations about real human relationships, thereby lowering satisfaction.

**Q: Can we feel true intimacy through digital communication alone?**
A: Research indicates that digitally-mediated relationships have the potential to reach levels of intimacy comparable to face-to-face interactions if sufficient time and text-based communication occur. However, overall satisfaction and immersion tend to be lower than in face-to-face interactions due to the lack of nonverbal cues and immediate physiological responses.

**Q: Will the emotion of 'love' remain the same even after the singularity?**
A: Empirical prediction is impossible regarding how human consciousness itself might change after the singularity. However, considering that the traditional concept of love was based on filling mutual deficiencies, in an environment where all deficiencies are technologically resolved, the motivation and expression of love are highly likely to transform. The purpose of relationships may shift from fulfillment to coexistence or co-creation.

## Conclusion

The technological singularity does not dismantle human relationships in the name of convenience; rather, it demands a fundamental re-examination of their very reason for existence. We must prepare for a future where we may no longer be together to fill each other's deficiencies. Instead, we need training to find the value of relationships in mutual discovery, the sharing of vulnerability, and the joy of connection beyond mere utility. It is time to remember that true intimacy can only blossom within the imperfect process that demands effort and understanding.
