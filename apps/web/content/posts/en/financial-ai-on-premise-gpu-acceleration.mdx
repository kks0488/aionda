## TL;DR
- Financial AI adoption moves toward revenue generation and cost reduction.
- Open-source models on-premises can help protect security and data sovereignty.
- NVIDIA hardware speeds up risk analysis and reduces trading latency.

Example: Cold mechanical sounds echo through a warm server room. Computing devices sense market trends and process trades before humans can perceive them. These machines help protect asset values in a shifting landscape.

## Status
Financial institutions are expanding AI investment. NVIDIA's 6th 'State of AI in Financial Services' report details this growth. Many firms use AI for trading and document processing. They also use it for fraud detection and risk management. Hardware like NVIDIA H100 and Blackwell GPUs can accelerate compute-heavy workloads such as Monte Carlo risk analysis. In practice, the exact speedup depends on the model, implementation, and infrastructure, so it is safer to treat published acceleration claims as workload-specific examples rather than universal help ensure.

In South Korea, regulations are changing. The FSC released a roadmap on August 13, 2024. It permitted generative AI usage. It also expanded cloud usage for finance. For highly sensitive workflows, teams still consider on-premise and closed-network deployments to balance security and efficiency.

## Analysis
Data sovereignty and security drive open-source AI adoption. Financial data requires strict protection and regulatory compliance. Open-source models can stay within internal environments. This reduces the risk of external data leaks. Firms can fine-tune these models for specific strategies. High costs and technical needs remain barriers to entry. The 2024 roadmap relies on a regulatory sandbox. Adoption speed depends on future legislation and enforcement. Balancing speed and safety is the main goal.

## Practical Application
Strategists should consider both safety and performance. API methods can struggle with strict financial regulations. Lightweight open-source models on internal hardware are useful. Efficient hardware deployment can improve computational results.

**Checklist for Today:**
- Review if internal anonymization follows Financial Security Institute guidelines.
- Test open-source model performance on local NVIDIA hardware setups.
- Use the regulatory sandbox to secure pseudonymized training data.

## FAQ
**Q: Does using open-source models increase security risks?**
A: Open-source models can process data within closed networks. This setup helps prevent data transmission to external servers. It can lower the risk of leaks compared to commercial APIs.

**Q: Do NVIDIA GPUs affect trading returns?**
A: They can expand the set of scenarios a team can evaluate within the same time budget. NVIDIA’s Numba example shows that some algorithmic trading simulations can be accelerated by over 100x on GPUs, but results vary widely by workload and implementation.

**Q: Can Korean financial firms use generative AI?**
A: Yes, following the August 13, 2024 roadmap. Firms should use the regulatory sandbox for pseudonymized data. For security-sensitive workflows, on-premise and closed-network deployments remain an option.

## Conclusion
The industry is moving toward monetization through AI. Open-source models and hardware performance are key drivers. Flexible regulations also support this shift. Using pseudonymized data and fast computation will define competitiveness.
