# AI Platform Wars: Differences in User Experience Across Web, App, and Desktop

Beyond their core conversational features, AI services are defined by inconsistencies in cross-platform user experience (UX) and differences in technical implementation. Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini have each adopted different file processing limits and chat history management methods, with features often being limited in mobile environments. These differences go beyond mere inconvenience, requiring users to make strategic choices about which platform to use for which task to achieve optimal results.

## Current Status: Investigated Facts and Data

Claude and ChatGPT officially support web browsers and iOS/Android mobile apps. Differences are most pronounced in the desktop app arena. Claude offers broad support for macOS 11+ and Windows 10+, while ChatGPT's macOS app requires Apple Silicon (M1 or later) chipsets. Linux users must access most services via web browsers or CLI tools, as official desktop apps are generally unavailable.

File upload limits show clear differences between services. ChatGPT has a default limit of 512MB per file, Claude 30MB, and Gemini 100MB. In terms of document processing, Gemini supports up to 2,000 pages, while Claude's analysis of visual elements may be limited for PDFs exceeding 100 pages. ChatGPT imposes limits based on token count (approximately 2 million tokens per file).

## Analysis: Meaning and Impact

Differences in file capacity and processing methods reflect each service's backend infrastructure and cost structure. Supporting larger capacities means requiring more powerful computing resources and optimized file parsing engines. This forces users to make strategic decisions, such as whether to upload a single large file or split it into several smaller ones.

Chat history management and synchronization mechanisms are key technologies for overcoming the limitations of stateless LLMs. Services typically maintain recent conversations using a sliding window approach and manage long-term history using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology with vector databases. This simulates the impression of 'memory' for the user at the application layer. Cloud-based centralized architectures and hybrid database structures are the technical foundation enabling real-time synchronization across multiple devices.

## Practical Application: Methods Readers Can Use

Choose your primary platform based on your work environment. Apple Silicon MacBook users might consider ChatGPT's native desktop app, while those who switch between Windows and macOS could benefit from Claude's cross-platform support. If analyzing large files is your main task, prioritize testing ChatGPT's 512MB limit. For extracting text from long documents, test Gemini's support for up to 2,000 pages first.

Be aware of and adapt to feature limitations on mobile. It may be more efficient to postpone complex file uploads or deep analysis tasks requiring long context to desktop or web environments. Since chat history is mostly synced and linked to your account, develop a habit of separately archiving important conversations or saving summaries of key points.

## FAQ

**Q: Which desktop app should I choose on a Windows PC, Claude or ChatGPT?**
A: Both services officially support Windows 10/11. The choice should primarily be based on file processing capacity and interface preference. Claude has a 30MB file upload limit, while ChatGPT allows up to 512MB.

**Q: Which service should I use to analyze a 150-page PDF with AI?**
A: Gemini officially supports up to 2,000 pages. Claude's analysis of visual elements may be limited for PDFs over 100 pages, potentially focusing more on text extraction. You could also consider splitting the file to process it within ChatGPT's token limits.

**Q: How securely and for how long is chat history stored?**
A: Chat history is stored on the service provider's cloud servers, linked to your account. Long-term history is managed for performance optimization, stored in vector databases and retrieved to be included in context when needed. It is recommended to store absolutely critical information on separate storage media.

## Conclusion

Choosing an AI service is a strategic decision that goes beyond simply comparing model performance. It requires a comprehensive evaluation of the user's primary work environment (desktop/mobile), the scale and format of files to be processed, and requirements for conversation history management. The wise approach is to accurately understand the support status and technical constraints of each platform and combine the optimal tools and environments according to the type of task.
