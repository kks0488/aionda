The era of free technology is coming to an end. Market logic eventually attaches a price tag to every free service.

The recent "open" AI trend is a sophisticated market strategy. It is the result of calculated capitalist logic, not altruism.

## A Trojan Horse for Market Share
Companies utilize free-to-use policies to dominate markets in their early stages. By lowering barriers to entry, they preemptively capture the ecosystem.

The case of Meta’s Llama clearly illustrates this strategy. Once a sufficient developer ecosystem is secured, the model pivots toward monetization.

## The Reality of Immense Computing Costs
Training frontier models costs billions of dollars. Data center maintenance expenses cannot be sustained through philanthropy.

Investors are now strongly demanding concrete revenue models. Free distribution is no longer a sustainable option for corporations.

## Commercial Clauses Hidden in Licenses
"Open weights" are distinct from true open source. These licenses invariably charge companies that exceed a certain size.

Such commercial restrictions are intentional from the design phase. This represents a meticulous revenue structure characteristic of market-driven entities.

## An Alternative Perspective: Ecosystem Contribution
It is undeniable that free releases have accelerated the democratization of technology. They remain a powerful tool for small-scale startups.

However, this is merely a byproduct. The ultimate destination for any corporation is always the maximization of profit.

## Look at the License, Not the Marketing Rhetoric
We must remain wary of the rhetoric of "free" used by tech companies. The fine print in license documents is far more important than any distribution manifesto.

The business model defines the true identity of the technology. Do not be deceived by strategic "free-to-use" offerings; evaluate their value with cold objectivity.
