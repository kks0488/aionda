In January 2026, while the snow-covered slopes of Davos, Switzerland, served as a stage for discussing the glamorous future of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) industry, it also became the site where a massive fissure first surfaced. Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, took a direct shot at NVIDIA, his company's largest investor and key partner. Even a $10 billion investment and a $30 billion computing contract could not serve as a shield against the justification of national security. Silicon Valley's tech alliance is reeling as it hits the massive geopolitical wave of "tech security."

## "Like Selling Nuclear Weapons": Amodei's Declaration of War

At this year’s Davos forum, Dario Amodei intensified his criticism of NVIDIA's plans to export chips to China, comparing the act to "selling nuclear weapons to North Korea." At the center of this criticism are the H20 chip, which NVIDIA designed for the Chinese market, and the H200, which recently received conditional export approval.

NVIDIA's H20, a strategic model for China, had its computing performance (based on FP16) lowered to 296 TFLOPS to evade U.S. government regulations. This is only about 15–20% of the flagship H100’s performance. However, NVIDIA was clever. While the computing speed was throttled, the memory bandwidth—the pathway through which data travels—was maintained at a high figure of 4.0 TB/s. This strategy maximizes "inference" efficiency rather than AI model "training," resulting in a product designed to bypass regulatory nets while still enabling the implementation of substantial AI services.

As of January 2026, the U.S. government partially opened the regulatory gates by conditionally allowing the export of the H200 accelerator to China, which was previously strictly prohibited. Amodei focused on this exact point. He warned that once high-performance chips fall into China's hands, it becomes impossible to control whether they are used for civilian or military purposes. Anthropic maintains its "Constitutional AI" principle, which ensures its AI models do not threaten human safety, and argues that the hardware supply chain must align with this stance.

## Tension Behind a $10 Billion Investment and $30 Billion Contract

The reason this incident is shocking the industry is the unique relationship between Anthropic and NVIDIA. NVIDIA, along with Microsoft, is a core shareholder that has jointly invested over 22 trillion KRW (approximately $10 billion) in Anthropic. Furthermore, in November 2025, the two companies signed a $30 billion computing resource supply contract. Anthropic is absolutely dependent on NVIDIA's chips to develop models optimized for NVIDIA’s next-generation architectures, Blackwell and Vera Rubin.

However, Amodei’s remarks demonstrate a determination that AI model developers will not remain merely as customers or investees of hardware suppliers. He has made it clear that tech security and ethical values take precedence over business partnerships. This is a disconcerting development for NVIDIA. The company has been employing desperate measures, such as cutting performance down to technical limits, to comply with U.S. regulations without abandoning the massive revenue source that is the Chinese market.

This conflict reveals a distinct difference in perspective within the AI industry. Hardware companies like NVIDIA and AMD support "controlled exports" to maintain market share and slow down China’s development of independent chip technology. Conversely, model developers like Anthropic and Google DeepMind react more sensitively to the destructive consequences that could arise if powerful AI models fall into the hands of autocratic regimes or hostile forces.

## The Era Where Tech Security Becomes a "New Risk" for Corporations

This debate goes beyond a simple war of words between companies and suggests new practical challenges facing AI firms. Now, technical prowess or capital alone cannot dominate the market. The ability to manage geopolitical risks has become a key variable determining corporate survival.

First, uncertainty in hardware supply and demand has increased. Following Amodei’s hardline remarks, it remains uncertain whether NVIDIA will prioritize Anthropic in future next-generation chip allocations. Companies must now consider strategies to reduce dependence on specific hardware suppliers.

Second, policy risks are unsettling technology roadmaps. U.S. administration export regulations are changing daily, with the introduction of performance density limits and special export licensing systems. While conditional export of the H200 is permitted as of 2026, it is unknown when it might be banned again due to political pressure. Companies must prepare for scenarios where they lose major markets or face disruptions in the supply of core components.

Third, "moral verification within the value chain" will be strengthened. Anthropic’s move will likely influence other AI startups. There is a growing awareness that receiving an investor’s money is separate from supporting that investor’s business practices.

## FAQ

**Q: What is the secret behind the NVIDIA H20 chip maintaining performance while passing regulations?**
**A:** NVIDIA significantly lowered the computing performance (TFLOPS) below government guidelines. However, it set the memory bandwidth, which is critical for data processing efficiency, at a high 4.0 TB/s. This is a technical workaround strategy designed to maximize efficiency in the "inference" stage (the actual service phase) rather than AI training, ensuring Chinese customers do not experience significant inconvenience in real-world usage environments.

**Q: What practical benefit does Anthropic gain by criticizing NVIDIA?**
**A:** Rather than short-term practical gain, the intent is likely to solidify its brand identity as a provider of "Safe AI." It can also be interpreted as a strategic move to influence future U.S. government regulatory directions, thereby blocking competitors from utilizing Chinese capital or technology. This includes the intention to secure an advantage in government subsidies or public sector contracts by instilling the perception that its models align with national security.

**Q: Is there a possibility that NVIDIA’s investment in Anthropic will be withdrawn due to this conflict?**
**A:** To date, there is no confirmed evidence that NVIDIA has officially withdrawn its investment or revised the contract. Since the $30 billion computing contract is directly linked to the survival of both companies, it is unlikely to be terminated in the short term. However, this conflict could certainly have a negative impact on future discussions for additional investment or the prioritization of next-generation chip supplies (such as Vera Rubin).

## Conclusion: The End of Technical Alliances and the Beginning of "Value Alliances"

Dario Amodei’s criticism at Davos declared that the AI industry is no longer a field of pure technical competition. AI is now a strategic asset directly linked to national security, moving beyond semiconductors, models, and data. The clash between NVIDIA and Anthropic is a symbolic event showing how vulnerable partnerships bound by technical interests can become when they collide with political values.

In the future, investors will look not only at a tech company’s financial statements but also at its geopolitical positioning, and developers will have to consider which country's chips their code is running on. Technology may have no borders, but the semiconductors that run that technology are being marked with clear national boundaries. Davos 2026 has broadcasted that cold truth to the entire world.
