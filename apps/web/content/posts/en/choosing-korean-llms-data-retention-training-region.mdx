## TL;DR
- The selection focus is shifting from model names to training use, retention, and region conditions.  
- This matters because retention rules can differ by feature and affect audits and security reviews.  
- Next, draft a feature-level checklist and re-verify it during your PoC configuration.  

In a vendor review meeting, the first question often becomes, “Where does this conversation log end up?”  
The Korean quality question tends to come next.  
This order often reflects deployment constraints.  
Choosing a Korean LLM often starts with data destination, retention time, and usage purpose.  
Documentation details can affect whether deployment seems feasible.  

Example: A security owner and developers discuss deployment in the same room. They demo a flow where consultation content enters the system and a summary is produced. They consider adding features. They then discuss what gets stored and who handles deletion.  

## Current state
In LLM adoption, the higher-impact question is often not “Is Korean good?”  
It is “Is my data used for training, are logs retained, and where is it processed?”  

OpenAI states in its platform data controls documentation a dated rule.  
It says: “As of March 1, 2023, data sent to the OpenAI API is not used.”  
It adds an exception unless you explicitly opt in.  
Related documentation and notices also mention default retention language.  
One example is “retained for up to 30 days.”  
What is retained can vary by policy and feature.  

A second axis is that “retention” can mean different things.  
OpenAI documentation describes abuse monitoring retention as “up to 30 days.”  
It separately states Responses API Application State is “30 days by default.”  
It also includes: “Objects that are not deleted… are retained indefinitely.”  
So, “the API is 30 days” can miss operational details.  
You should verify what objects are created by enabled features.  
You should also define who owns deletion responsibilities.  

A third axis is region.  
Data residency and region processing can look similar.  
They are not identical terms.  
OpenAI explains in-region storage for some eligible customers.  
It frames this as in-region storage “at rest.”  
It also states relevant projects process requests “in-region.”  

Azure OpenAI Service posts describe base models as stateless.  
They say standard API calls do not retain prompts or completions.  
They also note that optional service features may retain data.  
They state such data remains within your Azure tenant.  
They also say it stays within the same geographic region.  
Platform storage and processing units can differ across offerings.  
This can matter even for similar model families.  

## Analysis
This trend does not end debates about Korean quality.  
Teams that care about quality can still get blocked earlier.  
The block can come from the data path, not performance.  

Even with “not used for training” language, retention clauses can matter.  
Examples include “up to 30 days” for abuse monitoring.  
Another is “30 days by default” for Application State.  
A third is indefinite retention for objects not deleted.  
Security and legal teams may ask for feature-level clarity.  
They may ask what to turn off, what to delete, and what to separate.  
So, LLM selection can become engineering plus policy design.  

There are risks as well.  

First, summaries like “they don’t retain data” can omit exceptions.  
A “standard API call” can differ from storage-oriented features.  
Examples include file upload, threads, vector stores, and logging.  
OpenAI guidance similarly suggests feature-by-feature review.  
It suggests checking what is retained, where, and for how long.  

Second, benchmark results may not reflect operational performance.  
Research points out benchmark data contamination risk.  
It can overestimate performance under some conditions.  
Cross-lingual contamination via translations is also discussed.  
Another study reports MT metric inflation in some conditions.  
It reports differences up to 30 BLEU points.  
So, “#1 Korean performance” claims can be fragile.  
You should verify what evaluation data was built from and how.  

## Practical application
If your ecosystem map starts with model names, decisions can flip later.  
You can put deployment conditions at the top instead.  
Then you can fit candidates underneath those constraints.  
The sequence is typically:  

1) Training use (opt-in or opt-out)  
2) Retention period and exceptions (logs, state, undeleted objects)  
3) Region (separate storage at rest from processing in-region)  
4) Use of storage-oriented features (files, threads, vector stores)  
5) Then, a Korean quality PoC  

In the PoC, avoid relying only on a Korean average score.  
Build a verifiable ground truth from domain documents and conversations.  
To reduce contamination risk, avoid using internal materials as-is.  
Prepare a separate evaluation set with checked sources.  
Also check duplication likelihood where feasible.  
Additional verification may be needed for training data inclusion risk.  

**Checklist for Today:**
- Quote the vendor sentence about training use, including defaults and opt-in language.  
- Write “up to 30 days,” “30 days by default,” and “retained indefinitely” as separate retention items.  
- Split residency requirements into storage at rest and processing in-region, then document what you require.  

## FAQ
**Q1. If “our data is not used for training,” isn’t that the end?**  
A. It may not be the end.  
Training use is separate from log, state, and object retention.  
OpenAI documentation includes “retained for up to 30 days.”  
It also states Application State is “30 days by default.”  
It also says objects not deleted can be retained indefinitely.  
You should confirm this for the features you enable in operations.  

**Q2. If we meet data residency, do regulatory issues go away?**  
A. It can be hard to assume storage and processing align.  
OpenAI describes in-region storage for eligible customers.  
It also states requests for a relevant project are processed in-region.  
You should define whether you need storage only or processing too.  
Then confirm how far documentation covers your needed scope.  

**Q3. What should we trust for Korean performance comparisons?**  
A. External benchmarks alone can be risky.  
Research notes benchmark data contamination can overestimate performance.  
It also discusses cross-lingual contamination via translation.  
There are reports of MT inflation up to 30 BLEU points.  
You can reduce risk with internal evaluation and contamination checks.  

## Conclusion
Choosing a Korean LLM is not only a performance race.  
You should start with data control design.  
That includes training use, retention, and region.  
First, lock deployment conditions.  
Then compare candidates within that scope.  
Next, decide how far you will use storage-oriented features.  
Confirm how that choice changes retention, region, and deletion duties.  
Then re-validate with the PoC configuration.
