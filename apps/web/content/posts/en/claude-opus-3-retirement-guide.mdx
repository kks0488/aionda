Are you suddenly experiencing errors in your Claude API integrations? (Problem)
Anthropic has **officially terminated service for the Claude Opus 3 (`claude-3-opus-20240229`) model** as of January 5, 2026. The only solution is to switch to the more powerful **Opus 4.5**. (Solution)
According to the official release notes, this change is not just a version upgrade. It signifies a quantum leap in cost-efficiency and intelligence. (Evidence)

## 🚨 Urgent: Opus 3 Requests Are Failing

Since January 5, all API requests sent to the legacy model `claude-3-opus-20240229` return an error. Developers must update their model IDs immediately to prevent service disruption.

### Why Say Goodbye to Opus 3?
Anthropic provides a clear reason:
> "Opus 4.5 offers **significantly improved intelligence** at **a third of the cost** of Opus 3."

## Opus 4.5: What Has Changed?

Opus 4.5 is not merely a successor. It is Anthropic's masterpiece, optimized for complex reasoning, coding, and agentic tasks.

### 1. Overwhelming Cost-Performance
The biggest change is cost reduction. If your company was using Opus 3, you can **save 60-70% on API costs simply by swapping the model**, without any additional optimization. This is a massive advantage for teams running large-scale services.

### 2. 'Thinking' Model (Extended Thinking)
Opus 4.5 possesses **Extended Thinking** capabilities similar to OpenAI o1.
- **Complex Coding**: Excellent at analyzing spaghetti code and refactoring.
- **Agent Workflows**: Significantly lower error rates in scenarios requiring sequential tool use.

### 3. Enhanced 'Effort' Parameter Control
The new `effort` parameter allows developers to directly control the balance between token usage and response quality.
- `low`: Fast response, cost saving (simple queries)
- `high`: Deep thinking, thorough verification (critical decision making)

## 👉 Action Plan: Migration Checklist

Take these steps immediately to prevent outages and boost performance.

### 1. Change API Model ID
Search your entire codebase for the model ID and update it in bulk.

```diff
- model: "claude-3-opus-20240229"
+ model: "claude-3-opus-4-5-20251124"
```
*(Note: Check the Anthropic Console for the exact latest model ID. Version dates may vary.)*

### 2. Prompt Optimization
Opus 4.5 follows instructions better, but excessive "gaslighting" prompts (e.g., forced Chain of Thought) tailored for Opus 3 might actually degrade performance. Simplify your prompts.

### 3. Experiment with `effort` Parameter
If you are cost-sensitive, adjust the `effort` parameter to find the optimal cost-performance point.

## FAQ: Questions About Opus 3 Retirement

### Q1. I need Opus 3 for research purposes. Is there any way?
**A.** General API access is disabled. However, you can apply for limited access for research purposes through Anthropic's [External Researcher Access Program](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/9125743-what-is-the-external-researcher-access-program).

### Q2. Has the Haiku model changed as well?
**A.** Yes, Claude Haiku 3.5 was also announced for deprecation as of December 19, 2025. We recommend migrating to Haiku 4.5.

### Q3. Will existing prompts work the same on Opus 4.5?
**A.** Most will work better, but for complex logic, you must perform regression testing. Opus 4.5 has better context understanding, so it might not need as many detailed few-shot examples as before.
