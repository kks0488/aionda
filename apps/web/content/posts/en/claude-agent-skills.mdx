Are you tired of entering long prompts every time you ask a general-purpose AI to do a specialized task? (Problem)
In October 2025, Anthropic introduced a new concept called **'Agent Skills'**. This is a feature that bundles instructions, scripts, and resources required for a specific task into a single folder (Skill) and equips the AI with it. (Solution)
Developers can now package domain expertise into 'Skills' and distribute them across the organization. (Evidence)

## What are Agent Skills?

### 1. Anthropic-managed Skills (Default Skills)
High-quality skills pre-made by Anthropic.
- **Office Skills**: Skills to freely handle PowerPoint (PPTX), Excel (XLSX), and Word (DOCX) files.
- **PDF Analyst**: Skills to precisely analyze PDF documents containing complex tables and charts.

### 2. Custom Skills
Companies can create their own workflows as skills.
- Ex: "Skill to refactor according to our company's code style guide"
- Ex: "Skill to organize data adhering to the monthly marketing report format"

## How It Works
Skills are not just collections of prompts. Combined with **Code Execution tools**, they manipulate files and process data through actual Python scripts. In other words, Claude uses its 'hands' rather than just 'speaking'.

## Impact of Introduction
With the introduction of this feature, Claude can be used like a **digital employee performing a specific job**, going beyond a simple chatbot. It is like hiring an expert who can be deployed immediately without onboarding costs.
