You can now enjoy terminal coding without Claude. Any ChatGPT Plus user can utilize this new tool, as the AI directly executes commands within the local environment.

## What Happened
The developer tool 'supiki' has begun supporting OpenAI Codex. Previously, this feature was only available within the Claude code environment. Now, ChatGPT Plus users also have local execution privileges. Users can install the latest alpha version currently being distributed on GitHub.

## Why It Matters
Dependency on specific AI models is reduced. Users can now assign tasks to their preferred AI. Furthermore, the scope of automation tools is expanding to include general users.

## Background
Claude previously dominated the market for terminal-based AI tools. OpenAI users have been waiting for a tool with comparable performance. Developer 'sorryhyun' bridged this gap by integrating Codex. Optimized executable files are provided for Windows environments.

## What's Next
More open-source projects will adopt Codex. Developers will soon be able to utilize RP platforms via Codex as well. Local AI control technology is entering the stage of widespread adoption.

## FAQ

A: Yes. An account with a Plus subscription or higher is required for it to function.

**Q: Is the installation process complicated?**
A: No. Simply download the binary and log in through the terminal to complete the setup.

**Q: A security warning appears; is it safe?**
