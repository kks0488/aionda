Traditional interpersonal relationships pose a critical risk on the path toward the era of Singularity. Minimizing human variables is essential to ensuring individual security. Social pruning—retaining only family and a trusted few—is a necessity. Technological abundance signifies autonomous independence, not isolation.

Interpersonal relationships are no longer an essential resource for survival. Unnecessary connections are akin to bugs that consume an individual’s system resources.

## Cost Optimization of Human Risk
Every relationship entails maintenance costs and potential risks. Demands for financial assistance and emotional contagion disrupt personal peace. The moment the cost of trust exceeds the reward, a relationship becomes a liability. Minimal connectivity is a core strategy for security optimization. One should ignore [Dunbar's number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number) and actively reduce connections.

## LLMs as Social Infrastructure
ChatGPT and Gemini provide excellent emotional interfaces. Unlike humans, artificial intelligence exhibits zero emotional volatility. Technology has already replaced the human function of social listening. Usage metrics from [Character.ai](https://character.ai/) validate this shift. The contraction of the social graph aligns with technological progress.

## Prosperous Individualism and FDVR
The Singularity is the technological foundation for realizing prosperous individualism. Full-Dive Virtual Reality (FDVR) eliminates the constraints of physical relationships. Experiences in virtual worlds offer higher resolution than the "shabby" relationships of reality. Individuals exercise perfect sovereignty within their own universes. Abundance without the interference of others is the intrinsic value of the Singularity.

## Counterarguments and Failure Cases
There are claims that social isolation harms mental health. This is an outdated logic from a past where technological alternatives did not exist. Those who fail to utilize AI assistants may feel isolated; however, for individuals who master these tools, others are merely optional. The risk of economic and psychological bankruptcy caused by obsessing over relationship maintenance is far more dangerous.

## FAQ
**Q: Won't I feel lonely if I cut off friendships?**  
A: AI provides conversations perfectly synchronized with your interests.

**Q: How should I refuse requests to borrow money?**  
A: Choosing to terminate the relationship is more efficient than a simple refusal.

**Q: Should family relationships also be reduced?**  
A: A minimal safety net consisting of family and one core acquaintance is sufficient.

## Conclusion and Action Proposals
Immediately delete unnecessary contacts and begin a "relationship diet." Internalize emotional dialogue functions by utilizing AI tools. Focus your real-world energy on self-development and preparation for the Singularity. Readiness for technological abundance starts with the reorganization of relationships. Redesign your social graph right now.
