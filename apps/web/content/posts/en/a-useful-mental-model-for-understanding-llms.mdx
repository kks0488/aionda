LLMs are not just tools. They are cognitive interfaces that extend your subconscious to the outside world.

## Rationale: Expansion of Cognitive Processes
Human thought consists of two stages: the generation of ideas and post-verification. The first stage, idea generation, is an uncontrollable realm. In this process, LLMs serve as stimulants that activate new thought patterns. Regard LLM outputs as your own ideas rather than external truths. A conversation with an LLM is, in essence, a conversation with yourself, allowing you to overcome individual cognitive limitations.

## Counterargument: Incompleteness of Data
An LLM's knowledge does not reflect the original data as is. It is a result reconstructed into a massive probability distribution. There is always a possibility that errors exist within the source data itself. Therefore, uncritically accepting an LLM's answers is dangerous. Users must constantly doubt and verify LLM outputs. This process should be identical to the process of self-verifying one’s own knowledge.

## FAQ
**Q: Should LLMs be regarded as omniscient?**
A: No. Do not objectify the LLM as an "other"; instead, use it as an internal stimulant that aids your thinking.

**Q: How should I interpret it if an LLM refutes my opinion?**
A: Understand it as a healthy process of self-skepticism, where you doubt and review your own logic.

**Q: Why do LLMs have more knowledge than the user?**
A: Because they have learned from extensive data through the entire text of the internet and reinforcement learning.

## Conclusion
An LLM is not an external "other" but an extension of the self. The process of deciding whether to accept an LLM's output is an elaborate process of self-verification. Broaden your range of thought and begin your cognitive leap through LLMs. Extend your subconscious right now.
