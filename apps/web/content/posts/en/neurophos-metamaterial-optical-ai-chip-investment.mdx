## TL;DR
- Neurophos raised 110 million dollars to develop metamaterial-based optical AI inference chips.
- Metamaterials help control light to overcome the physical limits of traditional silicon semiconductors.
- This technology aims to improve efficiency and reduce costs during the AI model inference stage.

Example: Data centers become quiet as cooling fans stop spinning. Light flows through clear paths to process complex computations. Small chips handle workloads that once required large servers. Heat issues diminish while processing speeds remain high.

The AI industry faces challenges with high power consumption. Running large language models contributes to carbon emissions and rising energy costs. On 2026-01-22, Neurophos announced an investment of 110 million dollars. They develop optical processors that use metamaterials. This technology aims to improve efficiency during AI model execution.

## Current Status: Application of Metamaterial Technology to AI Chips
The funding shows the potential for optical computing in AI markets. Metamaterials are the core technology for the company. These materials tune the refraction and reflection of light. Neurophos applies this to matrix multiplication for AI tasks.

Standard chips lose energy due to heat in electronic circuits. Optical chips transmit information using light to reduce resistance. This can lead to faster processing and lower power use. The processors are designed to be compact for various applications. They can fit in smartphones or large data centers.

Strategic investors suggest the technology is moving toward industrial use. Power efficiency is a primary factor in the inference market. Neurophos aims to lower operational costs by solving power bottlenecks.

## Analysis: Advantages and Challenges of Optical Computing
Optical computing addresses energy issues in the AI industry. Data transfer often uses more power than the actual computation. Light-based computing can reduce energy loss during data movement. Metamaterials allow for complex functions in a very small area. This provides an advantage for the miniaturization of AI chips.

Technical challenges still remain for this technology. Converting light back into digital signals can cause latency. Compatibility with existing software ecosystems requires further verification. New compiler technology can help run current AI models. Verification of mass-production processes is also necessary for these chips. Future performance metrics will determine if they become standard processors.

## Practical Application: How to Prepare for the Optical Computing Era
Enterprises should monitor changes in hardware architecture. Organizations can consider a wider range of hardware for on-device AI.

**Checklist for Today:**
- Analyze the proportion of power costs in current AI inference tasks.
- Research software development kits provided by optical computing companies.
- Design AI model architectures to remain flexible across different hardware.

## FAQ
**Q: Will metamaterial optical chips replace existing GPUs?**
A: They currently act as a complementary technology to GPUs. GPUs are suitable for training, while optical chips focus on inference.

**Q: Why use metamaterials?**
A: Standard materials cannot easily control light at very small scales. Metamaterials use nanostructures to enable mathematical operations in tiny spaces.

**Q: When will consumers experience this technology?**
A: Adoption will likely start in data centers and autonomous vehicles. Mass-production processes are still under development for future consumer use.

## Conclusion
The funding for Neurophos suggests interest is shifting toward optical hardware. Metamaterials in chip design align with the need for sustainable AI. Market interest focuses on how much this technology reduces data center costs.
