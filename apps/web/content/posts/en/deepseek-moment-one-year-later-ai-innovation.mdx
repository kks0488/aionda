## TL;DR
- MLA and DeepSeekMoE designs from DeepSeek-V3 are now common in models like Llama 4 and Qwen3.
- The GRPO technique provides a foundation for open-weight models to match commercial performance by reducing costs.
- Industry focus shifted from scaling to compute-optimized designs using FP8 training and Multi-token Prediction.

Example: An engineer improves a reasoning model for a specialized field on a personal computer. Tasks that previously required multiple devices and significant funding are possible for small teams through efficient computation. This style of development is now common for many creators.

As of 2026-01-28, the AI industry marks the first anniversary of the "DeepSeek Moment." The technical milestones of DeepSeek-V3 and R1 changed the focus from capital-intensive brute force. The influence of high-cost proprietary API models has diminished. New architectures that prioritize efficiency are taking their place.

## Current Status
AI architecture has evolved over the past year to secure better efficiency. DeepSeek-V3 utilized approximately 2.788 million H800 GPU hours for its training process. This is a low figure compared to models with similar performance levels. Such achievements were possible because of Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) technology. 

MLA reduces KV cache overhead during processing. DeepSeekMoE also maintains active parameters at around 4–5%. Llama 4 and Qwen3 use these designs in 2026. The Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) technique also lowers training costs for reasoning models. 

Developers can now apply models to their services by training them directly. They often use optimized open-weight models rather than relying on large corporate APIs. FP8 precision training and Multi-token Prediction (MTP) have also become common. The performance gap between open-weight and commercial models has narrowed. Companies can now choose models suitable for their own data and environments.

## Analysis
The DeepSeek Moment shifted the "Compute Moat" toward technical creativity. It was previously believed that only companies with large computing resources could create superior models. DeepSeek demonstrated that architecture optimization can bridge that gap. Capital logic no longer largely dominates the AI market.

Hardware manufacturers now focus on supporting low-precision operations below FP8. This change is shortening the replacement cycle for older accelerators. Data quality and domain-specific performance are now major competitive factors. Some closed models, like Claude 4.5, do not disclose internal architecture metrics. The discussion regarding technical transparency between open and closed models continues.

## Practical Application
Developers and companies should focus on inference efficiency rather than model size. Open-weight models are catching up to commercial APIs in performance. Strategies to increase return on investment relative to cost are helpful.

**Checklist for Today:**
- Review current API costs and consider moving to Llama 4 or Qwen3 for self-hosting.
- Apply GRPO when training reasoning models to reduce computing resources.
- Check if infrastructure supports FP8 precision and update quantization strategies.

## FAQ
**Q: Why is the DeepSeek architecture efficient?**
A: It reduces memory occupancy through MLA technology. The MoE structure uses only about 4–5% of the total parameters during computation.

**Q: How does GRPO differ from traditional reinforcement learning?**
A: Traditional methods require a separate model to evaluate answers. GRPO calculates relative scores within a group of answers to learn. This allows for reinforcement learning without a critic model.

**Q: Can small enterprises train high-level models directly?**
A: Training a base model still requires significant resources. However, fine-tuning existing open-weight models for specific purposes is possible at lower costs.

## Conclusion
The year following DeepSeek-V3 showed a shift from scale to intelligent efficiency. Competition no longer depends solely on the volume of resources held. Success now depends on performing deep reasoning with fewer resources. Moving forward, key points include the application of mHC technology in DeepSeek V4. The industry also watches how the closed-model camp responds to these changes.
