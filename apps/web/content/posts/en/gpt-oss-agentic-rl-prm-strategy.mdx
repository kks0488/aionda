## TL;DR
- Open-source models now use process-based reinforcement learning to improve their ability to use various tools.
- This approach helps bridge the reliability gap between open-source models and larger commercial alternatives.
- Users should adopt frameworks that reward individual reasoning steps to improve overall model performance.

Example: Imagine a system analyzing several reports to write a summary. The model selects specific functions in sequence. It identifies errors during the process and adjusts its logic. This sequence leads to a final output based on verified steps.

## Current Status


## Analysis
The design of the reward function often influences the success of Agentic RL training. Outcome-based methods only verify the final answer. These methods have limitations in controlling model hallucinations. Technical trends are shifting toward Process Reward Modeling. This approach assigns rewards to every intermediate step. Steps include query generation, evidence extraction, and answer generation.

ReasonRAG research shows PRM can achieve high performance with 5,000 instances. Existing methods like Search-R1 require 90,000 instances. This suggests efficient improvement is possible with less data. Abstention Calibration is another strategy of note. The model receives positive rewards for admitting uncertainty. This reduces the risk of incorrect tool calls. Reward systems can increase computational complexity. Frameworks like Agent Lightning help maintain efficiency.

## Practical Application
Organizations should focus on the RL training pipeline structure. Fact-check reward logic can improve tool-calling accuracy. This logic cross-references external knowledge bases in real-time.

**Checklist for Today:**
- Adopt the Agent Lightning framework to separate agent logic from the training pipeline.
- Apply Process Reward Modeling to reward intermediate reasoning steps and final results.
- Use Abstention Calibration to reward the model when it withholds uncertain answers.

## FAQ
**Q: Does the GPT-OSS 120B model perform like o4-mini?**

**Q: Which RL method reduces hallucinations?**
A: Process Reward Modeling is an effective choice. It rewards the logical validity of each step. This helps prevent the model from forcing a final result.

**Q: Can training efficiency be increased?**

## Conclusion
GPT-OSS and Agentic RL suggest that open-source AI is evolving. A robustness gap exists between open-source and commercial models. New frameworks and reward strategies are narrowing this gap. Designing reward functions for specific domains can be important.
