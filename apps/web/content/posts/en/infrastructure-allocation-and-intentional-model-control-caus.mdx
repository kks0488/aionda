Performance variations in Large Language Models (LLMs) are not a figment of user imagination. They are the result of infrastructure resource allocation combined with intentional model control. Heterogeneity in computing resources creates performance inconsistencies.

## Heterogeneity in Computing Resource Allocation

Not all inference servers guarantee identical performance. OpenAI operates clusters consisting of tens of thousands of GPUs. Within these clusters, there are aging hardware components or nodes subject to power capping. Load balancers assign users to servers randomly. If a user is unfortunately assigned to a low-performance node, inference speed decreases. This also negatively impacts the quality of token generation. While the [OpenAI Status](https://status.openai.com/) dashboard does not explicitly state this, latency fluctuations are a reality.

## Intentional Intelligence Disparity and A/B Testing

OpenAI updates its models through "canary deployments." Multiple checkpoints exist under the same name, such as GPT-4o. Specific user groups may be assigned lightweight models for testing purposes. This is a standard procedure for reducing operational costs and optimizing performance. Data from the [LMSYS Chatbot Arena](https://chat.lmsys.org/) substantiates performance gaps between different model versions. Users may be included in a lower-performance experimental group without their knowledge.

## Dynamic Quantization and Inference Cost Optimization

During traffic spikes, systems perform "Dynamic Quantization." This technique reduces model precision to maintain computational speed. Precision may drop from FP16 levels to INT8 or lower. As precision decreases, logical reasoning capabilities slightly deteriorate. The effectiveness of this technique can be confirmed in the [NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM) documentation. Disparities in intelligence are an intentional design choice to withstand system loads.

## Impact of User Proficiency and Prompting

Some argue that performance degradation is due to a lack of user proficiency in prompt engineering. Imprecise instructions fail to extract the full potential of a model. However, fluctuations in output for the identical prompt are attributable to system variables. It is illogical to blame users while disregarding environmental factors. The phenomenon of model "Drift" is a documented technical fact in academia.

## FAQ

**Q: Do paid subscribers also experience performance degradation?**
A: Yes. Server assignments and test groups are divided even among paid users.

**Q: Are servers in specific regions superior?**
A: Differences occur based on the available GPU resources at different cloud hubs.

**Q: Are there settings to avoid performance degradation?**
A: The only alternative is to use specific model versions through the API.

## Action Suggestions for Performance Consistency

If you perceive a drop in performance, start a new conversation immediately. A new session increases the probability of being assigned to a different computing node. If consistent performance is essential, use the API instead of the ChatGPT interface. The API allows for the specification of model versions (e.g., `gpt-4-0613`), resulting in fewer performance fluctuations. Record system logs to identify patterns of performance degradation through data.
