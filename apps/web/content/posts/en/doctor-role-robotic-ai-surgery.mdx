# When Robots Hold the Scalpel: What Is the Role of the Doctor?

While robot-assisted surgery is spreading and the tools and technologies in the medical field are rapidly evolving, the weight of final judgment and responsibility still rests on the shoulders of human doctors. At the center of this change, complex emergency situations or fields requiring immediate judgment are difficult to replace with automation, whereas specific medical specialties focused on image interpretation and analysis are expected to be more directly impacted by new technologies. This signifies that an era has arrived which demands not merely the introduction of technology, but a redefinition of the very essence and expertise of the profession of being a doctor.

## Current Status: Investigated Facts and Data

The official training pathway for the Da Vinci system, a representative commercially available surgical robot, follows a 4-stage 'Technology Training Pathway' defined by the manufacturer. This pathway consists of online education, simulation, clinical observation, and proctored surgery under the supervision of a skilled surgeon. While 10 assistant participations and 20 console surgeries are typically recommended for official certification, the final qualification criteria and required time are defined differently according to each hospital's internal regulations. There is no globally unified minimum training time, and the required number of proctored surgeries varies from 2 to over 10 cases depending on the institution.

Recent meta-analysis studies comparing the clinical effects of robot-assisted surgery show distinct advantages and disadvantages. Robotic surgery has been confirmed to have benefits including lower complication rates, shorter hospital stays, and less blood loss compared to traditional open surgery. However, when compared to laparoscopic surgery, no significant difference was found in overall complication rates. Robotic surgery has a lower conversion rate to open surgery than laparoscopic surgery and shows technical superiority in specific fields requiring delicate manipulation, such as rectal cancer surgery. On the other hand, its operative time is the longest among all methods, and costs are high.

## Analysis: Meaning and Impact

This data emphasizes that robots are not entities that 'replace doctors' but tools that 'extend doctors' capabilities.' The fact that surgical robot training has a dual structure of formal technical acquisition stages and institution-specific qualification certification is because a doctor's proficiency and judgment in utilizing the technology are considered more important assets than the technology itself. Although robotic surgery may be disadvantageous in terms of time and cost, the fact that it provides benefits in areas related to patient recovery suggests that the value of introducing the technology lies not in simple efficiency but in the qualitative improvement of treatment outcomes.

Meanwhile, the advancement of artificial intelligence is bringing more direct change to specialties whose main tasks are diagnosis and analysis. AI-based image interpretation systems are improving diagnostic accuracy, reducing interpretation time, and enhancing work efficiency in radiology and pathology. Research indicates that using AI-assisted systems can reduce interpretation errors and improve documentation efficiency by up to 40%. The scope of research is expanding beyond simple interpretation to include emergency patient triage and verification of interpretation reports using generative AI. This shows the possibility that the role of doctors in these fields will evolve from simple repetitive interpretation to final verification of AI-proposed results and comprehensive judgment of complex cases.

## Practical Application: Methods Readers Can Utilize

If you are a medical professional, you should focus not on fearing robots or AI, but on clearly understanding what 'assistive' functions this technology can perform in your field. In the surgical domain, robots should be approached as tools that enable delicate manipulation of anatomical spaces that were previously difficult to access. While investing in technical training, equal effort should be made to develop complex decision-making and emergency response capabilities that robots cannot perform.

Radiologists and pathologists need to accept AI not as a competitor but as a collaborator that helps manage interpretation workload and reduce errors. To this end, it is key to deepen understanding of the limitations and potential biases of AI algorithms, and to maintain and enhance the expertise to critically review AI outputs. In all fields, doctors must reaffirm that they are the sole responsible parties for interpreting the data provided by technology and making the final clinical judgment in light of the patient's overall condition and context.

## FAQ: 3 Questions

**Q: How much training is required to become a surgeon who operates surgical robots?**
A: The official training pathway for the Da Vinci system consists of 4 stages, and typically 10 assistant roles and 20 console surgeries are recommended. However, the final qualification criteria and required time vary according to each hospital's internal regulations, and there is no absolutely unified minimum time.

**Q: Does robotic surgery really bring better outcomes than conventional surgery?**
A: According to research, robot-assisted surgery has advantages such as lower complication rates and shorter hospital stays compared to open surgery. However, when compared to laparoscopic surgery, there is no significant difference in overall complication rates. Instead, it shows advantages in specific surgeries requiring delicate manipulation, while also having disadvantages such as longer operative time and higher costs.

**Q: If AI replaces image interpretation, will radiologists lose their jobs?**
A: Current research trends focus on AI assisting rather than replacing doctors. AI improves interpretation accuracy and work efficiency, helping doctors focus more on judging complex cases and patient care. The role of doctors is expected to evolve from simple interpretation to final verification of AI results and comprehensive judgment.

## Conclusion: Summary + Actionable Suggestions

The spread of robotic surgery and artificial intelligence is not eliminating the role of the doctor, but rather reorganizing it. Surgeons will shift their position to being operators of sophisticated tools and final decision-makers responsible for unpredictable situations in the operating room, while radiologists will shift to being verifiers who filter the vast amounts of data generated by AI and deliver the final diagnosis. What is required of medical professionals in this era of change is not blind acceptance or rejection of new technology, but strategic adaptation that involves understanding the limitations of technology and further honing the capacity for clinical judgment and responsibility that only humans can perform.
