Delays in knowledge discovery processes impede business growth. OpenAI presents a natural language-based knowledge extraction solution through ChatGPT. The GPT-4o model ranked first on the [LMSYS Chatbot Arena](https://chat.lmsys.org/?leaderboard) with an ELO score of 1287.

## Why It Matters

Large Language Models (LLMs) replicate human cognitive processes and significantly reduce working hours. [Goldman Sachs](https://www.goldmansachs.com/intelligence/pages/generative-ai-could-raise-global-gdp-by-7-percent.html) analyzed that AI could boost global GDP by 7% over the next decade. Enterprises now define AI as a core infrastructure rather than a mere tool.

This technology resolves information asymmetry and lowers the barrier to professional expertise. By reducing human intervention in data analysis and summarization tasks, it shifts the productivity curve upward. Companies that take the lead in establishing technical standards are highly likely to secure dominance in future markets.

## Background

The Transformer architecture, introduced in 2017, formed the foundation of modern language models. OpenAI has refined the GPT series by investing massive datasets and computing resources. Since the launch of ChatGPT, artificial intelligence has evolved into "multimodal" systems capable of processing voice and images beyond just text.

Early models were limited to predicting the probability of the next word. Today, their logical structures have become robust enough to perform complex reasoning and coding tasks. The expansion of NVIDIA's GPU supply has supported the training and operation of these large-scale models.

## Common Mistakes / Failure Cases

Serious incidents occur when users accept AI responses without verification. In 2023, American attorney Steven Schwartz submitted fabricated legal precedents generated by ChatGPT to a court. As a result, the lawyer faced legal discipline and a $5,000 fine. This is a typical error that occurs because AI focuses on the probabilistic plausibility of sentences rather than factual accuracy.

## FAQ

**Q: Has the bias issue in AI models been completely resolved?**  
A: While bias is suppressed through Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), it has not been possible to completely eliminate bias inherent in the training data.

**Q: Is there a risk that corporate confidential data will be used for training?**  
A: Enterprise accounts provide security options that exclude user data from model training.

**Q: Can AI perfectly perform professional coding tasks?**  
A: While it excels at drafting code, logical error verification must be performed by human developers.

## Actionable Advice

Enable the 'Custom Instructions' feature immediately. By setting your profession and preferred response style, you can reduce unnecessary follow-up questions. Statistically, the accuracy of AI responses increases as you assign a specific persona.
