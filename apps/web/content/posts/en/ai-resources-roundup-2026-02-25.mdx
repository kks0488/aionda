## Practical Application
**Checklist for Today:**
- Review your AI-assisted dev/refactor workflow and borrow ideas from the Next.js rebuild and agent-team thinking to update internal playbooks.
- Pick one AWS reference architecture (video inference/photo search/training/structured outputs) and map it to a pilot in your product.
- Track the compressed-model news, defense AI dispute, and research pieces to refresh your risk checklist across deployment, governance, and org dynamics.
