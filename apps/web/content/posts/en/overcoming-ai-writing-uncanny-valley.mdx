## TL;DR
- While sentences written by artificial intelligence are grammatically accurate, their standardized patterns often create an emotional distance from the reader.
- In communication environments requiring trust and empathy, the neutral and predictable writing style characteristic of AI can hinder immersion and undermine authenticity.
- When utilizing AI, it is essential to set specific personas, adjust sentence lengths.
Involve a human editing process to supplement context in the final stage.

Example: You receive an email with no errors—it is well polished and logically sophisticated. However, it feels cold and rigid, as if reading a pre-defined answer key. Because the writer's presence cannot be felt, you close the window before even finishing the text.

This is the reality of the limitations and resistance we face daily regarding AI writing styles. In an era where text generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) is widespread, we paradoxically find ourselves yearning for human-centric narratives. Major AI developers such as Google, Meta, and OpenAI are striving to improve the fluency and naturalness of text through technical reports, yet the emotional distance felt by users remains a challenge to be solved.

## Current Status

As fluency and naturalness are emphasized in the performance metrics of major language models, AI-generated text is being distributed in large quantities. According to the GPT-4 Technical Report released in 2023, the model demonstrates human-level performance across various professional and academic benchmarks. In particular, it has improved factuality and instruction-following capabilities through post-training alignment processes. Google’s Gemini Ultra also recorded 90.04% on the MMLU (large Multitask Language Understanding) benchmark, aiming to provide a natural conversational experience.

The Llama family (Llama 3), announced by Meta in 2024, also emphasizes the ability to mimic human conversation patterns. These models are designed to write consistent and context-aware text based on enhanced vocabulary and comprehension. These developers primarily utilize Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to guide models to converse in ways that humans prefer.

Example: When an AI revised a user's rough draft, the sentences became smooth, but the author's unique humor and tone disappeared, transforming the text into a standardized style similar to a public service announcement.

However, this fluency is concentrated on grammatical accuracy and logical consistency. Detailed sub-guidelines used by developers to measure naturalness are often treated as confidential, and there are limitations in quantifying the appropriateness of emotional expression or subtle tonal shifts depending on the situation.

## Analysis

The fundamental reason AI writing styles cause resistance lies in the RLHF process used to align the models. In the process of adjusting the model to avoid biased or offensive remarks, the writing style takes on a neutral and defensive character. When this process is repeated, the text structure becomes sophisticated, but the characteristics of human language—asymmetry, unpredictability, and emotional variation—are reduced.

Furthermore, there is a correlation between the structural completeness of information and linguistic naturalness. Humans do not arrange all information in a logical sequence when speaking. They sometimes state the conclusion first, mix in interjections, and use omissions depending on the situation. Conversely, AI tends to generate sentences that converge toward the average values of its training data, opting for predictable word combinations. The reason readers fail to feel individuality in AI-written text is precisely this predictability.

In the industry, this is sometimes referred to as the "Uncanny Valley of Text." As grammar becomes more accurate, the fact that the text was not written by a human becomes even more prominent, causing discomfort. Particularly in texts where sincerity is key, such as apologies or expressions of gratitude, the characteristic politeness of AI can actually be counterproductive.

## Practical Application

Users should go beyond simply asking the AI for revisions. Technical guidance is necessary for natural communication. A strategy of setting the AI as a writer with a specific personality and context, rather than just a tool, is vital.

Example: When writing a report, provide instructions to use a tone as if a senior colleague is advising a junior, and use metaphors instead of technical jargon.

Clarifying constraints when constructing prompts is another effective method. Asking the AI to mix various sentence lengths or restricting the use of certain words can mitigate its characteristic tone. Rather than using the AI's output as is, a human editing process is required to add context and unpredictability at the final stage.

**To-Do List for Today:**
- Directly delete or replace cliché transitions in AI outputs, such as "In conclusion," "Furthermore," and "Above all."
- Add instructions to the prompt to alternate between short and medium-length sentences.
- Read the final text aloud and manually refine sections where the breath feels rushed or the phrasing becomes too long.

## FAQ

**Q: What is the main reason readers realize a text was written by AI?**
A: It is because the sentence structures are overly consistent, and every paragraph follows a similar logical progression of introduction-explanation-conclusion. Human writing contains unique habits or emotional emphases, but AI lacks individuality because it follows the average patterns of its training data.

**Q: Shouldn't RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) make it more natural?**
A: RLHF trains the model to provide responses that appear appropriate to humans, but this process prioritizes safety and versatility. As a result, it converges into a safe, polite style that avoids controversy, which can feel like mechanical kindness to users and actually hinder naturalness.

**Q: What is an effective prompt strategy for creating a natural writing style?**
A: It is to set a specific audience and situation. Rather than simply asking to "refine the text," providing a specific background—such as a tone for sharing news with an old friend or a situation explaining complex concepts to a non-technical colleague—allows the model to use a more appropriate style.

## Conclusion

The fluency of artificial intelligence has reached a high level. Models like GPT-4, Llama series, and Gemini produce results similar to human experts in terms of grammar and logic. However, technical sophistication does not automatically equate to successful communication. What readers want to find in a text is context and connection beyond mere information.

Future AI communication will move beyond the stage of simply fixing typos and smoothing sentences; it will be a battle of how to infuse human elements into mechanical precision. As technology advances, we are learning the true power of the most human language.
