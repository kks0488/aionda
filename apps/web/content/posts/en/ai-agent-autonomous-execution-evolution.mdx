## TL;DR
- AI agents have evolved from single text generators into long-running structures that operate autonomously for weeks.
- Improved screen perception allows agents to control software directly and complete complex tasks more reliably.
- Users should transition to state-based graph workflows and establish secure environments for autonomous agents.

Example: The cursor moves across the display to sort various files into folders. It browses through multiple websites to gather information for reports and saves them. Without specific human guidance, the system chooses its own path and finishes work over extended periods.

## Current Status: The Shift Toward Execution-Centric Agency
The architecture of AI agents has shifted from being generation-centric to execution-centric.
Following attempts to standardize enterprise agents in 2025, execution persistence has expanded in 2026.
Frameworks from 2026 support long-running functions that track goals over many days or weeks.
The Computer Use Agent method allows systems to perceive screens and control hardware inputs.
Models like JoinAI_V2.2, GPT 5, Gemini 3 Pro, DeepSeek 3.1, and Qwen 3 showed high success rates.
This suggests agents can operate autonomously in web environments and software interfaces.
Users now manage complex tasks through state-based graph structures instead of simple commands.
Agents identify their own progress and use reasoning loops to modify their strategies.
They can return to previous steps if an error occurs during the process.

## Analysis: Impact and Challenges of Agent Adoption
This allows the use of complex internal software that is hard to describe with text.
However, expanded autonomy brings certain risks that users should consider.
Execution costs can rise due to repeated computational loops during long tasks.
Verifying intermediate decisions during multi-day operations can be difficult for human observers.
Security discussions are ongoing regarding agents with direct operating system control.
Cost-efficiency data for specific industries still requires further verification.

## Practical Application: Strategies to Prepare for Autonomous Agents
Enterprises and developers should shift toward forming autonomous teams rather than just building chatbots.

**Checklist for Today:**
- Diagram current workflows into state-based graphs that define failure points and decision criteria.
- Build an isolated sandbox environment where agents can safely control software and manage security.
- Establish performance standards relative to reasoning costs to evaluate time and labor savings.

## FAQ
**Q: What is the difference between existing LLM services and AI agents?**
A: Existing LLM services generate answers, but agents act to achieve specific goals.
Agents in 2026 select tools, manipulate systems, and correct their own errors.

**Q: Is the 90.7% success rate maintained in actual work?**
A: This figure reflects performance in standardized environments.
Fields with many exceptions like medicine or law still lack sufficient data.
Human review stages should be integrated into these workflows initially.

**Q: Do errors occur if the agent operates for a long time?**
A: Long-running agents can restart from interruption points using state-saving technology.
Monitoring systems remain necessary because external variables can still cause interruptions.

## Conclusion
AI is evolving from a simple tool into an autonomous colleague in 2026.
Framework standardization and computer control technology are changing how work is done.
Users should adapt to a model of setting goals and delegating tasks.
Future challenges include proving profitability and defining human responsibility for AI actions.
