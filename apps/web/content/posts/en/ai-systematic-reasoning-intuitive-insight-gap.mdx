# The Gap Between Systematic Reasoning and Intuitive Insight in AI

Current artificial intelligence solves problems in a 'model student' manner, relying on explicit, step-by-step reasoning processes. However, the true general artificial intelligence (AGI) that humans expect requires the ability to intuitively grasp the core of a problem within large-scale neural networks. Understanding this gap is a key challenge in exploring the essence of AGI.

## Current Status: Investigated Facts and Data

The formal approach to defining 'intuition' in neural networks borrows theories from cognitive science. DeepMind's AlphaGo research formalized this by analogizing how policy and value networks instantly evaluate board states without explicit search to the 'intuition' of a human Go master. Yoshua Bengio's research borrows Daniel Kahneman's 'System 1' theory, defining current deep learning as a fast, unconscious, non-verbal intuitive processing system.

Experimental results comparing the performance of systematic and intuitive reasoning support this. Research by Jason Wei et al. demonstrated that systematic reasoning (Chain-of-Thought) outperforms intuitive reasoning on complex mathematical and logical problems. However, results also confirmed that for simple problems or specific domains like text classification, the intuitive approach is more efficient or the performance difference is minimal.

## Analysis: Meaning and Impact

These research findings suggest that AI's problem-solving approaches should not be unified. The ability itself to distinguish domains where intuitive processing is advantageous from those requiring systematic reasoning could be a marker of advanced intelligence. Current AI over-relies on 'reasoning' that requires lengthy thought processes, which acts as a limitation in terms of energy efficiency and response speed.

Quantitative metrics for measuring intuitive judgment in large-scale neural networks are still under development. Researchers use proxy metrics such as zero-shot accuracy or consistency scores based on datasets like GSM-Symbolic. Recently, attempts have emerged to separate pattern matching from logical reasoning, such as the performance gap with and without reasoning steps (CoT Delta) or Γ and Δ metrics.

## Practical Application: Methods Readers Can Utilize

When designing or evaluating AI systems, it is necessary to choose the appropriate reasoning method according to the complexity and type of problem. While applying systematic reasoning techniques to complex multi-step logical problems, intuitive processing can be optimized for tasks requiring rapid pattern recognition. When evaluating performance, it is useful to analyze the system's strengths and weaknesses from multiple angles using a set of metrics by reasoning type, rather than a single metric.

## FAQ

**Q: Are AI 'intuition' and human intuition the same?**
A: The 'intuition' used in current AI research is closer to a metaphorical definition borrowing the 'System 1' concept from cognitive psychology. Rather than being defined by a single, mathematically identical formula, it refers to a processing method that is fast, unconscious, and occurs without an explicit reasoning process.

**Q: Is systematic reasoning (CoT) always better performing than intuitive reasoning?**
A: No. According to research, while CoT shows superior performance on complex problems, on simple problems or specific classification tasks, intuitive reasoning methods may be more efficient or the performance difference may not be significant.

**Q: How is AI's intuitive ability measured?**
A: There is no single, formally agreed-upon standard metric. Researchers utilize proxy metrics such as zero-shot accuracy, consistency scores on specially crafted datasets, or performance differences before and after applying systematic reasoning (CoT Delta).

## Conclusion

The path toward AGI lies in fusing the accuracy of systematic reasoning with the efficiency of intuitive insight. The implementation of metacognitive ability to appropriately switch between these two systems is emerging as the next key challenge. By subdividing problem domains and designing reasoning approaches optimized for each, researchers and developers will be able to build more flexible and human-like intelligence models.
