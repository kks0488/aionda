# The Evolution of Safety in Autonomous Vehicles: The Real Conditions for Pilot Replacement

The automation of large vehicles goes beyond simply being a matter of sensors and algorithms. Its core depends on how to solve the unique challenges of 'emergency response capability' and 'inaccessible environments'. Replacing pilots will begin not with replicating technical knowledge, but with catching up to human 'timing' and 'speed of action'.

## Current Status: Investigated Facts and Data

Currently, the aviation, maritime, and railway sectors define their levels of automation with different international safety standards. The maritime sector follows the four-level MASS (Maritime Autonomous Surface Ship) standard set by the International Maritime Organization (IMO). Railways apply the GoA (Grade of Automation) levels 0 to 4 according to the IEC 62290 standard by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). The aviation sector, governed by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), distinguishes and regulates 'remotely piloted aircraft' and 'autonomous aircraft', building a certification system based more on technological maturity and pilot intervention rather than a formal numbered stage standard.

Research data exists that quantifies the emergency response capabilities of human pilots. Simple reactions to predicted warnings are fast, within about 1.5 to 2.5 seconds. However, when an unexpected emergency occurs accompanied by a startle effect, the response time can be delayed to an average of 8 to 12.5 seconds. During this process, accuracy for untrained scenarios drops sharply.

## Analysis: Meaning and Impact

This data shows the clear wall that autonomous systems must overcome to replace humans. The system must execute judgment and physical actions equal to or better than a human within 8 to 12.5 seconds, not only in predictable situations but also in completely unexpected 'startle' situations. This goes beyond simple rule-based automation, requiring creative problem-solving and adaptive learning capabilities.

Because of this high barrier, the timeline for pilot replacement is projected to be similar to or later than that for blue-collar job replacement. While road-based commercial transport (buses/taxis) with relatively simple control environments and easier external intervention shows potential for faster replacement, more time will be needed to prove the reliability of autonomous systems in isolated airspace or vast oceans.

## Practical Application: Methods Readers Can Utilize

Stakeholders and technology developers should shift automation discussions away from stepwise levels to specific performance metrics. Setting clear goals such as "Respond to X type of emergency with Z% accuracy within Y seconds" is more useful than "Level 4 automation." Furthermore, a comparative analysis of the different approaches of standardization bodies (IMO's 4 levels, IEC's GoA, ICAO's maturity-based approach) allows for a deeper understanding of the safety philosophy and technology adoption barriers of each transport mode.

## FAQ

**Q: What is the foremost technical challenge that must be solved for autonomous aircraft to be commercialized?**
A: The most critical challenge is proving the reliability of a system to make and execute safe decisions within the human pilot's average response time of 8-12.5 seconds during unpredicted, complex emergency situations. This is a robustness issue spanning the entire process of sensing, judgment, and control.

**Q: Why do maritime and railway automation standards have clearer numerical frameworks than aviation?**
A: Maritime and railway sectors have relatively constrained traffic environments and lower dynamic complexity. This provides a foundation for more easily defining risk scenarios and applying standardized automation levels. Aviation involves many more variables, such as high-speed movement in three-dimensional space and complex weather conditions.

**Q: Can autonomous systems overcome the human 'startle effect'?**
A: Autonomous systems are inherently not 'startled.' However, the key is how the system responds when a completely new failure mode, not used in training the prediction algorithms, occurs. For this, extensive stress testing through simulation and failure-robust design are essential.

## Conclusion

The evolution of safety in autonomous vehicles is not a process of checking off standardized stages like a checklist. It is a fundamental inquiry into quantifying the cognitive limits of human operators and exploring how technology can complement and replace those limits. Technology developers and regulatory authorities must now move away from the abstract concept of 'automation levels' and focus on direct comparison with human performance metrics such as 'emergency response time' and 'accuracy in untrained scenarios.'
