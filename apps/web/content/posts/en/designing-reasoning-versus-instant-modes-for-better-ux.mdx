## TL;DR

- Reasoning and instant modes can shift answer quality based on the user’s mode choice.  
- The trade-off involves latency, cost, and metrics like `pass@1` and `pass@10`.  
- Add mode defaults, clearer explanations, and streaming, then track `budget_tokens` with latency.  

A user clicks **“Thinking (Reasoning)…”** and sees only a waiting indicator.  
They often switch to **“Instant response”** to move faster.  
That choice can shape perceived quality over time.  

Example: A user asks for help checking a long argument. The screen shows a vague waiting state. The user switches to fast mode and gets a shallow reply. They later avoid the slow mode.

There is one core issue.  
UX for choosing between “think-more” and speed-first options can affect trust.  
Documentation describes reasoning models using internal chain-of-thought tokens before answering.  
It also lists tasks where reasoning can help, like coding and multi-step planning.  
Some docs present success rates as `pass@1` and `pass@n`, such as `pass@10`.  
Anthropic docs note `budget_tokens` can exceed `max_tokens`.  
Users may click “Instant” if the UI does not explain these trade-offs.

## Current state

Documentation defines Thinking or Reasoning as internal chain-of-thought generation before answering.  
Instant response is framed as lower extra reasoning and lower latency.  
The UI label may vary, and that detail can need verification.  
Even with the same question, some categories can benefit from more thinking time.  
That benefit often comes with extra latency.  

Docs also describe where gaps can appear.  
OpenAI API guides say reasoning models excel at complex problem solving.  
They also highlight coding, scientific reasoning, and multi-step planning.  
Some system card text contrasts “Instant” and “Thinking” behaviors.  
It suggests “Instant” targets conversational flow and adaptive reasoning.  
It suggests “Thinking” calibrates thinking time more directly per question.  

Performance and cost framing connects to UX decisions.  
Some docs use `pass@1` to describe success in one attempt.  
Some use `pass@n`, including `pass@10`, for multiple attempts.  
Anthropic documentation says `budget_tokens` can exceed `max_tokens`.  
That implies internal thinking budget can grow beyond output token limits.  
That growth can increase latency and cost.

## Analysis

This looks like behavior design, not only a mode toggle.  
Users may choose instant response for tasks where reasoning helps.  
That choice can reduce the effective `pass@1` experience in the product.  
If reasoning is used for simple chat, latency and cost can rise.  
Docs describe how `budget_tokens` can grow independently of `max_tokens`.  
The UX goal can be waiting mainly when the task benefits.  

The risks can split into two categories.  

First, unclear waiting can look like malfunction.  
OpenAI documentation says streaming helps for long outputs.  
Streaming can make progress visible, not just delayed.  

Second, metrics can mislead product decisions.  
`pass@1` and `pass@10` assume multiple attempts are possible.  
Many users do not run multiple attempts in a UI.  
The product can decide to “try more internally” by thinking longer.  
That decision can shift latency, cost, and perceived reliability.

## Practical application

If you reduce it to If/Then rules, the design can get simpler.  

- **If** intent suggests correctness needs, **Then** default to reasoning for that request.  
- **If** intent suggests light conversation or summarization, **Then** default to instant response.  
- **If** the user is waiting, **Then** use streaming to show visible progress.  

**Checklist for Today:**
- Add one sentence explaining the speed versus quality trade-off near the mode control.  
- Enable streaming for long responses to show progress while reasoning runs.  
- Log `budget_tokens` with latency and mode choice for later UX tuning.

## FAQ

**Q1. What exactly is different about ‘Reasoning/Thinking’?**  
A1. Docs describe internal chain-of-thought tokens before answering.  
They describe step-by-step solving before the final response.  
Instant response is contrasted as using less extra reasoning for speed.  

**Q2. For which tasks is it beneficial to turn on reasoning mode?**  
A2. OpenAI API guides list complex problem solving as a strong area.  
They also list coding, scientific reasoning, and multi-step planning.  
Quantitative comparisons can need separate validation per product context.  

**Q3. How do you reduce users repeatedly clicking ‘Instant’ via UX?**  
A3. Use streaming to turn waiting into visible progress.  
Consider mode defaults that follow question type, not manual choice alone.  
Track `budget_tokens` growth as an operational factor tied to latency.

## Conclusion

Reasoning-mode UX can be shaped on the screen, not only in the model.  
`pass@1` and `pass@10` imply benefits from additional attempts or effort.  
Users may still click “Instant” without understanding compute trade-offs.  
A practical next step is clearer explanations, streaming progress, and mode defaults.  
If/Then rules can reduce accidental quality loss from repeated speed-first choices.
