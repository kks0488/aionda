A chronic challenge in AI video production has been that the 'protagonist of yesterday is different from the protagonist of today.' Creators have long been troubled by phenomena where a character's features change minutely with every frame or background textures lose consistency. Google has introduced Veo 3.1 to tackle this problem head-on. Equipped with the 'Ingredients to Video' feature, this model presents a new solution to the lack of consistency, a persistent issue in AI-generated video.

## Visual Anchors Built with Data

At the core of Veo 3.1 is 'Ingredients to Video,' which utilizes up to three reference images as 'Visual Anchors.' When a user inputs images defining a character, background, specific object, or style, the system intelligently analyzes and synthesizes them. While previous models relied solely on text prompts—generating videos akin to a 'random draw' each time—Veo 3.1 operates based on clear reference points provided by the user.

This approach suppresses 'Identity Drift,' where character identities become blurred or backgrounds appear to jitter. It provides the control necessary to ensure the same character wears the same clothes and stays in the same space across multiple generated scenes. Alongside this, Google has released the 'Flow' interface accessible via the Gemini API. This includes 'Frames to Video' and 'Extend' features, adding flexibility to video generation. 'Frames to Video' is an interpolation technology that naturally fills the gap when a user specifies the start and end frames of a video. 'Extend' secures continuity by understanding the context of the entire last second of an existing clip to extend the scene.

## Changing the Grammar of Video Production Through Control

In the video industry, consistency is a necessity, not an option. If a protagonist's appearance changes in every cut during the production of an advertisement or short film, the commercial value is non-existent. The level of control shown by Veo 3.1 suggests that generative AI has moved beyond being a mere experimental tool and is ready to be integrated into actual production pipelines. In particular, the support for 1080p resolution and increased visual density are attractive elements for professional creators.

However, it is not all rosy. The limitation of three reference images can cause a bottleneck in tasks requiring complex narratives or diverse background transitions. According to Google's data, performance in maintaining character and scene consistency can vary in actual results depending on the user's work environment or prompt complexity. This means that despite technological advancements, sophisticated human guidance and iterative attempts remain variables that determine quality.

Furthermore, the powerful synthesis capabilities provided by 'Ingredients to Video' cannot be free from copyright and deepfake controversies. This is because there is a risk of unauthorized replication of real individuals or specific artist styles based on reference images. It remains to be seen what filtering policies and watermarking technologies Google will refine to prevent such misuse.

## What Creators Can Start Right Now

Developers and creators can now directly test the features of Veo 3.1 through the Gemini API. The first step is to prepare images containing character sheets, background concept art, or a specific artistic style for inspiration.

The specific usage scenario is as follows. First, upload a full-body image of a core character and a background image as 'Ingredients.' Then, give instructions for the desired action through a text prompt, and the system will generate a video while maintaining the characteristics of the reference images. If the video length is insufficient, use the 'Extend' feature to adjust the pacing, and if the connection between specific scenes is awkward, create a natural transition point with 'Frames to Video.' This workflow reduces modification tasks that previously took days of manual labor to just a few minutes.

## FAQ

**Q: Is control possible with only 3 reference images?**
A: Currently, Veo 3.1 provides three anchors optimized for defining characters, objects, and styles. While there may be limitations in very complex multi-character scenes, it shows significantly improved consistency compared to previous versions when building a narrative centered on a single protagonist. The possibility of expanding the number of reference images in future updates remains open.

**Q: Has the 'Identity Drift' phenomenon completely disappeared?**
A: 'Significantly improved' would be the appropriate expression. Although interpolation technology and context understanding for maintaining inter-frame continuity have been strengthened, minute distortions can still occur in prompts involving very dynamic camera work or extreme lighting changes.

**Q: Is Veo 3.1 a paid service, or is it provided as open source?**
A: Currently, Veo 3.1 is provided to developers through Google's Gemini API. The specific pricing policy follows the rate structures of Google Cloud and the AI developer platform, and general users can check access methods through Google AI for Developers.

## Conclusion

Veo 3.1 has shifted the grammar of AI video production from 'random generation' to 'intended control.' 'Ingredients to Video' acts as a powerful anchor, pinning the images a creator imagines onto the timeline of video. The key to AI video technology now lies not in how flashy a video it can create, but in how well it complies under the creator's control. It will be interesting to see how this visual anchor dropped by Google redefines the standards of video production sites.
