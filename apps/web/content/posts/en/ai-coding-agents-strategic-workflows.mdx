Example: A developer is tracing a coupling error in a complex distributed system. Previously, they would have navigated through multiple documents to copy and paste code, but now tools automatically read logs, modify internal logic, and propose solutions. Beyond the simple stage of writing code, an era has arrived where AI understands the entire development environment and broadcasts its reasoning process in real time.

As Large Language Models (LLMs) evolve from coding assistants into "Agents," they are demanding fundamental changes in development workflows. Developers now stand at a strategic crossroads, deciding which tools to deploy at which stages based on the unique characteristics of each model.

## TL;DR
- **What is changing?** With the standardization of tool integration via Anthropic’s MCP and the disclosure of DeepSeek’s Chain of Thought (CoT).
AI coding has shifted from "result generation" to "procedural problem-solving."
- **Why is it important?** As models develop distinct strengths (GPT for debugging, Claude for extensibility.
DeepSeek for logical reasoning), relying on a single model can lead to productivity bottlenecks.
- **What should readers do?** Decouple models by development stage. Establish a pipeline where DeepSeek’s reasoning process is referenced for initial logic verification, environment integration is performed in a Claude environment supporting MCP, and final inspection is conducted through GPT’s security logic.

## Current Status
The current coding AI market shows clear functional differentiation. On November 25, 2024, Anthropic released the "Model Context Protocol (MCP)" as open source, standardizing how AI models communicate with external data and tools. Using a client-server architecture based on JSON-RPC 2.0, it provides a standard specification for AI to directly access local files, databases, and external APIs. Currently, local MCP server integration is supported natively in Claude Desktop, Cursor, Zed, and VS Code (as of version 1.102), as well as through official extensions like GitHub Copilot Chat.

The surge of China-based DeepSeek is also notable. DeepSeek-R1 acquired the ability to explore and correct its own reasoning paths through a reinforcement learning algorithm called GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization). This model transparently exposes its Chain of Thought (CoT) using `<think>` tags in its output. It is characterized by its step-by-step logical progression in complex mathematical problems or algorithm implementations, with a maximum prompt length of 16,384 tokens and a response length of up to 32,768 tokens during the training of DeepSeek-R1-Zero.

The traditional leader, the GPT model family, maintains its step-by-step problem-solving capabilities based on security awareness. They still demonstrate effective performance in sophisticated debugging and expert-level code review, showing particular strength in providing clear guidelines as learning tools. In development environments, the trend is shifting toward integrating these individual APIs into specific workflows rather than using them in isolation.

## Analysis
These technical advancements provide developers with two primary opportunities: "resolving the black box" and "connectivity." The exposure of the reasoning process demonstrated by DeepSeek-R1 goes beyond simple readability. By allowing developers to immediately identify where a model has made a logical error, it reduces the risk of blindly accepting AI suggestions. This enables a practical implementation of "pair programming" where developers learn or correct alongside the model by observing its reflection process, especially when designing complex business logic.

Conversely, Anthropic’s MCP breaks down the physical limitations of AI. Traditional LLMs faced constraints in accessing the latest libraries not included in training data or private internal corporate codebases. By connecting these through a standardized interface, MCP helps AI execute local database queries or read document files in real time to understand context. This signifies that AI is evolving from a simple code generator into an operator that perceives and manipulates the entire development environment.

However, limitations remain clear. Integrating external tools via MCP inevitably carries security risks. Control mechanisms for unintended code execution or data leakage that may occur when granting AI access to local resources are still in their early stages. Furthermore, reasoning models like DeepSeek face a trade-off where they consume more tokens during the logic development process, potentially leading to relatively slower response speeds.

## Practical Application
A "model switching" strategy is essential for efficient development. Rather than trying to solve all problems in a single window, tools should be separated according to the nature of the task.

- **Algorithm Design and Complex Logic Implementation:** Utilize DeepSeek-R1 to monitor the reasoning process within the `<think>` tags. Check for missing edge cases by verifying the steps where the model corrects its own logic through self-verification.
- **Infrastructure Integration and Repetitive Task Automation:** Connect Claude with an MCP server. Quickly generate executable, complete code by having the model directly read local DB schemas or grasp the current project’s file structure.
- **Code Review and Security Vulnerability Assessment:** Input the implemented code into a GPT-based environment to be inspected for compliance with security policies and readability.

**Checklist for Today:**
1. Open the MCP configuration file in your IDE (VS Code or Cursor) and register a local data folder as a resource.
2. Input a complex, unresolved bug into DeepSeek-R1 and analyze what assumptions the model makes during the `<think>` process.
3. Convert frequently referenced internal API documentation into an MCP server format to build an environment where the AI can query it in real time.

## FAQ
**Q: Is using MCP a security risk?**
A: Risks do exist. When configuring an MCP server, you should restrict accessible directories to a minimum, prioritize read permissions over write permissions, and monitor the tasks performed by the AI.

**Q: Does it cost more if DeepSeek’s reasoning process becomes longer?**
A: Yes. Since the text consumed during the thinking process is included in the output token count, it is more economical to use it for problems requiring high-level logic rather than simple syntax questions.

**Q: Doesn't mixing multiple models cause context fragmentation?**
A: To prevent this, you should organize the outputs of each model in a shared repository or documentation tool. Recent IDEs are increasingly adding features to maintain context while switching between various model APIs on a single screen.

## Conclusion
The paradigm of AI coding has shifted from "who writes code better" to "who is better connected to the development environment and logically transparent." MCP provides the link to the external world.
While CoT provides transparency into internal thinking, assisting in developer decision-making.

Moving forward, the focus will be on how seamlessly the strengths of these individual models can be integrated into a single workflow. Developers should now move beyond being simple coders and develop the capabilities of an "Orchestrator" who coordinates multiple AI models and tools to derive the optimal architecture.
