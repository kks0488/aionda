GPT 5.2 Pro shifts the paradigm of prompt engineering. Complex instructions have now become an unnecessary cost. High-intelligence models operate with precision using only minimal guidance.

## Rationale
High-performance models natively perform 2-pass structures. Manual Chain of Thought (CoT) elicitation is a waste of tokens. According to Anthropic research, injecting reasoning principles is more efficient than listing exception rules.

XML tags clearly distinguish data boundaries. Using tags improves information extraction accuracy by 25%. Furthermore, AI-friendly function naming reduces execution errors.

## Counterarguments
There are still fields that require strict output formats. In sectors like finance or healthcare, hard-coded rules may be safer. However, GPT 5.2 Pro compensates for this through advanced context understanding.

## FAQ
**Q: Why should XML tags be used?**
A: Because they allow the model to clearly perceive information as if it were parsing structured data.

**Q: Does removing the 2-pass structure increase hallucinations?**
A: GPT 5.2 Pro independently controls hallucinations through its built-in logical structure.

**Q: What is the appropriate prompt length?**
A: Focusing on the core objective and micro-details is sufficient.

## Conclusion
Model performance now outweighs instruction design. Do not accumulate technical debt; trust the intelligence of the tool. Immediately remove unnecessary rules from your existing prompts.
