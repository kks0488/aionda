The cost of the most expensive "change of heart" in Silicon Valley history has arrived in the form of a $134 billion (approx. 180 trillion KRW) bill. As OpenAI, which began as a non-profit organization for humanity, transforms into a corporate giant eyeing a $500 billion market capitalization, Elon Musk—one of its original architects—has filed a lawsuit to challenge this trajectory. This legal battle goes beyond a simple financial dispute, targeting the fundamental contradictions in governance regarding how a public good like Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be privatized by the logic of capital.

## The Magic of Turning Donations into Equity: The $134 Billion Formula

The conflict between Elon Musk and OpenAI has crossed the point of no return. In October 2025, after OpenAI formalized its conversion into a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC) and removed profit caps for investors, Musk’s legal team immediately initiated legal action. The $134 billion in compensation sought by Musk is derived from combining the estimated value of his initial stake—within OpenAI's current projected valuation of $500 billion—with the legal theory of "Disgorgement" (restitution of wrongful gains).

Through this change in its articles of incorporation, OpenAI has established a structure capable of unlimited profit distribution and an Initial Public Offering (IPO). This effectively discards the founding principle of "maintaining non-profit and open-source status" specified in the original bylaws. Recently, a California court recognized that initial contributors like Musk have the legal "standing" to enforce these charitable conditions, moving the case toward a jury trial. OpenAI maintains that Musk’s initial contributions were pure donations rather than equity investments and that his claims to commercial rights have no legal basis. However, the momentum shifted when the court recognized Musk’s eligibility to sue.

The trial that will determine the fate of both camps is scheduled for April 27, 2026. Musk argues that the close partnership between OpenAI and Microsoft (MS) is a "fraud" that violates the original founding agreement, and is pressuring for a significant portion of OpenAI's commercial profits to be returned to early donors.

## AI Governance: Bankruptcy or Evolution?

The core issue of this lawsuit lies in the legal challenge of whether a "retroactive conversion of donations into equity" is possible. According to standard non-profit regulations, assets once donated cannot be returned as personal commercial equity under the "Asset Lock" principle. However, Musk approaches this not as a simple donation, but from a contractual perspective of a "Founding Agreement" predicated on specific conditions (maintaining non-profit status).

Legal experts expect this case to have a massive ripple effect on the "governance design" of AI startups. This is because it could place a legal check on "mission washing"—the practice of receiving government support or donations for public interest purposes in the early stages, only to switch to a for-profit model once the technology matures. If the jury sides with Musk, any hybrid company transitioning from non-profit to for-profit faces the risk of paying astronomical "retroactive equity shares" to early contributors.

On the other hand, there is significant critical pushback. Analysts argue that if OpenAI had not transitioned to a for-profit model, it would not have secured the massive computing resources required today, eventually losing out to Big Tech competitors like Google and Meta. The clash is between the realism of whether "AI for humanity" can be sustainable without capital and the principle that the company betrayed its founding spirit to monopolize profits.

## Practical Guide: Lessons for Those Dreaming of the "Next OpenAI"

For those currently operating or planning to invest in AI startups, this lawsuit serves as a textbook for governance risk management. It is no longer enough to use slogans like "We are doing good" to bind the complex interests of investors and early contributors.

First, "Mission Lock" regulations must be formalized. Unless the decision-making structure and asset valuation methods for transitioning from non-profit to for-profit are specifically embedded in the initial bylaws, they become the seeds of multi-billion dollar lawsuits. Second, contracts must clearly distinguish whether early contributions are "donations" or "investments in future equity." Verbal agreements or early email exchanges regarding "prohibition of profit conversion," as seen with Musk, can return as a $130 billion boomerang.

Finally, the results of the April 2026 trial are likely to establish precedents regarding the "obligation to open-source" AI models. Companies should strengthen legal reviews to determine if monetization strategies through closed models could legally constitute a "violation of public interest."

## FAQ: Three Key Questions About the Lawsuit

**Q1: How was the $134 billion demanded by Musk calculated?**  
A: Musk’s side calculated the scale of "wrongful gains" by assuming OpenAI’s current corporate value at approximately $500 billion and considering the value of his initial contributions and the 26% stake held by the OpenAI Foundation. This is based on the legal doctrine of "Disgorgement," which aims to recover the entirety of the defendant's ill-gotten gains rather than just simple compensatory damages.

**Q2: Does OpenAI’s conversion to a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC) help its case?**  
A: While converting to a PBC is a declaration to pursue both shareholder interests and public benefit simultaneously, it does not erase allegations of past contractual breaches. In fact, by removing profit caps, it may provide early contributors with a legal basis to claim they were "deprived of the opportunity for profit distribution."

**Q3: What will be the overall impact of the trial on the AI industry?**  
A: It could lead to the end of the "hybrid structure" where a non-profit foundation controls a for-profit subsidiary. If the court accepts even part of Musk’s argument, future AI companies will either have to start as fully for-profit entities from the beginning or undergo extremely rigorous valuation and compensation procedures when transferring non-profit assets to for-profit entities.

## Conclusion: The Value of "Open" Eclipsed by Capital Logic

The showdown between Elon Musk and OpenAI reveals one of the ugliest yet most fascinating aspects of technological innovation meeting capital. OpenAI argues it chose for-profit status for survival, while Musk expresses outrage that his contributions were stolen in the process.

Ultimately, the jury verdict in April 2026 will serve as a milestone determining whether AI is a common asset for humanity or the exclusive property of those who planted the flag first. We are witnessing not just a corporate success story, but the astronomical cost of governance failure. Going forward, readers should pay close attention to the pace of OpenAI's IPO and the actual substance of the "Founding Agreement" to be revealed during the trial.
