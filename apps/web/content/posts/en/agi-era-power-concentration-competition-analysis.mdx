# In the Age of AGI, Will Power Really Be Concentrated in One Place?

Concerns are spreading that after the technological singularity, the power of AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) will be controlled by a small, established elite. However, historical evidence and current market dynamics tell a different story. Power is not a single actor but a complex of conflicting interests, and market competition is a powerful force driving the proliferation and democratization of technology.

## Current Landscape: The AGI Ecosystem Where Competition and Cooperation Intersect

Today's AI ecosystem shows a landscape where clear leaders and fierce competition coexist. NVIDIA holds 80-85% of the GPU market for AI computing, and TSMC handles approximately 90% of high-performance semiconductor manufacturing. In the cloud infrastructure market, AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud compete with market shares of 30%, 21%, and 12% respectively.

Amidst this competitive landscape, super-large-scale collaborative projects are emerging. The $100 billion data center collaboration between OpenAI and NVIDIA is a prime example, and vertical partnerships are forming, such as the $500 billion 'Stargate' project involving OpenAI, Oracle, SoftBank, and the U.S. government. This represents a new form of competition emerging in the AGI development phase, where the concentration of capital and resources is essential.

## Analysis: How Market Mechanisms Disperse Power

History has proven that market competition is the most efficient driver of technology diffusion. According to quantitative research, when competition between platforms intensified in the broadband internet market, the penetration rate increased significantly. Analysis of the smartphone and PC markets also shows that competitive environments, compared to monopolistic ones, lead to faster technology adoption and steeper price declines, thereby promoting diffusion.

Academic modeling provides theoretical support for this phenomenon. Studies utilizing game theory and system dynamics analyze that competitive scenarios promote increased consumer welfare and technology diffusion, whereas monopoly scenarios incur opportunity costs of price increases and reduced innovation incentives. While a monopoly may be advantageous for concentrating complex R&D, it ultimately slows the overall expansion rate of the market.

## Practical Application: Strategic Thinking in a Changing Environment

This analysis provides practical insights for investors, policymakers, and corporate strategists. Rather than focusing solely on 'who will win,' it is important to predict how competitive pressures will promote price declines and improved accessibility of technology. The current mega-collaborative projects can be interpreted not as monopolies by a single company, but as strategic alliances to mobilize resources necessary for a specific development stage.

Monitor the key mechanisms of technology diffusion: pressure for return on investment and competitive imitation. Even if one company achieves a breakthrough in AGI, the presence of other large participating corporations and institutions in the market is likely to act as a check, preventing that technology from being locked into a closed system.

## FAQ

**Q: Isn't the overwhelming market share of companies like NVIDIA effectively a monopoly?**
A: A high market share signifies leadership at the current point in time, but it does not guarantee a sustained monopoly controlling the entire future AGI ecosystem. Competition and conflicting interests among cloud providers, semiconductor competitors, and participants in large-scale collaborative projects act as factors preventing power from concentrating in one place.

**Q: Is market competition always beneficial to society?**
A: Academic research notes that competition generally contributes to consumer welfare and technology diffusion. However, considering the massive initial capital required for R&D, concentration and cooperation at specific development stages may also be necessary. The key is whether the dynamics of competition and cooperation ultimately lead to the broad dissemination of technology.

**Q: What is the role of government?**
A: In the investigation, governments appear as part of large collaborations like the 'Stargate' project. This suggests that in AGI development, governments may expand their role beyond mere regulators to become strategic partners or infrastructure providers mobilizing massive capital. The extent to which policy subsidies, separate from competition, contribute to technology diffusion may vary by country.

## Conclusion

The power structure in the age of AGI should be viewed not as a simple pyramid but as a constantly evolving ecosystem. The benefits of the technological singularity are highly likely to spread throughout society, driven by the inherent properties of the market: competition and pressure for return on investment. It is time for us not to watch for the crowning of the strongest, but to analyze how the complex interplay of competition and cooperation leads to the democratization of technology.
