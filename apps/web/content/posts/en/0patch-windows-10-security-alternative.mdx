## TL;DR
- 0patch maintains business continuity through technology that fixes vulnerabilities in memory without requiring a system reboot.
- At an annual cost of approximately $30–$40, it reduces the economic burden compared to Microsoft's paid updates.
- It provides a practical security alternative for devices where operating system replacement is difficult due to high hardware specification requirements.

Example: If a Windows-based computer in a factory control room stops, the production line halts. In a situation where the time required to restart a system for security patches leads directly to losses, administrators often hesitate before the update button.

## Current Status: Cost Burden Following End of Support

In this context, 0patch operates a pricing policy of approximately $30 per year for Personal and Professional plans and approximately $40 (€35) for Enterprise plans. This is about one-third of the official Microsoft cost. Furthermore, unlike the official service which requires retroactive payments for unused periods, 0patch features a flexible structure where costs are paid from the point of subscription. Its core technology, micropatching, supplements vulnerabilities without business interruption by injecting fix code directly into the memory of running processes.

## Analysis: A New Alternative in the Security Market
The emergence of 0patch creates an environment where the end of support from an operating system manufacturer does not lead directly to the disposal of software. This serves as an alternative for industrial sites or public institutions where operating system upgrades are hard due to specialized software compatibility issues. A structure has formed where an external security firm, rather than the manufacturer, extends the lifespan of devices.

However, there are points to consider. Since 0patch creates patches by analyzing public security advisories, its scope of response may not be as comprehensive as that of a manufacturer holding the operating system's source code. Reliability verification required when introducing external patch management tools in large-scale enterprise environments is also a challenge. While some view the method of supplementing only specific parts without fundamental system modification with caution, its economic value is evaluated as sufficient when considering hardware replacement costs and losses from business downtime.

## Practical Application: Strategy for Extending Windows 10 Lifespan
Users and administrators should check their asset inventory and establish appropriate strategies for each device. Rather than transitioning all devices to a higher operating system, it is more efficient to categorize security methods based on hardware status and intended use.

Example.
Transition office devices to a higher operating system, while applying external security services to low-spec or special-purpose PCs to reduce maintenance costs.

**To-Do List for Today:**
- Identify the number of internal devices where operating system upgrades are hard due to hardware specification issues.
- Establish a spending plan by comparing official security update maintenance costs with external service license fees.
- Install the security service on a few devices first to check for conflicts with existing business software.

## FAQ
**Q: If I use 0patch, do I no longer need to receive security updates from the manufacturer?**
A: It serves to fill the security gap for operating systems where official support has ended and patches are no longer provided. For operating systems that still have a remaining support period, it is appropriate to prioritize applying the manufacturer's patches.

**Q: Does it affect system performance?**
A: Since it modifies a small amount of code in memory, a reboot is not required, and system resource usage remains at a low level.

**Q: Will this service remain valid even after the next operating system becomes widely adopted?**
A: As the required specifications for operating systems increase, the demand for continued use of older devices persists. Therefore, it is highly likely to maintain its value as an economic solution that compensates for the hardware gap.

## Conclusion
The end of support for Windows 10 has provided an opportunity for users to choose security strategies based on cost and efficiency. 0patch offers a practical solution for organizations seeking to maintain business continuity independently of the manufacturer's upgrade cycle. It is necessary to build a rational security system while paying attention to the impact external security services have on the software lifecycle.
