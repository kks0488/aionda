## Practical Application
**Checklist for Today:**
- If you’re running VLMs at the edge, use the Hugging Face Jetson post as your deployment starting point.
- If your roadmap includes physical AI, map your labeling pipeline against AWS’s VLM-based data annotation scaling approach.
- If you build on AWS, turn the AWS Weekly Roundup items (Bedrock, GovCloud, Agent Plugins) into a quick upgrade checklist.
