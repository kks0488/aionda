## TL;DR

- **What changed / what this is:** Portfolio-site generation can bottleneck during long revision loops with long outputs.  
- **Why it matters:** Pricing examples show higher output rates than input rates, so long outputs can raise costs.  
- **What you should do next:** Add workflow rules that limit output length, then compare tools on cost and iteration behavior.  

Example: A user asks for a more premium feel. The tool changes styles inconsistently. The user asks for consistency. The tool responds with longer code and explanations.

In the GPT-5.2 pricing example, output is $14.000 per 1M tokens.  
Input is $1.750 per 1M tokens.  

A portfolio site generated “in one shot” is often the starting phase.  
Cost and time can expand during later revision loops.  

Spacing can break, colors can drift, and layouts can shift.  
Users then restate requests in new words.  
The tool may output long code again each time.  

This post explains why the revision loop can become a bottleneck.  
It also suggests criteria for comparing coding assistants.  
Product-to-product comparisons may need extra confirmation.

## Current state

In vibe coding workflows, output length can affect cost and time.  
Conversation turns also matter, but they are not the only driver.  

A common pattern appears in portfolio-site work by non-developers.  
Users read long explanations.  
They receive long code patches.  
They then receive another explanation of that code.  

This pattern can increase output tokens over time.  

In an OpenAI API pricing example, GPT-5.2 input is $1.750 per 1M tokens.  
GPT-5.2 output is $14.000 per 1M tokens.  
The example presents output as more expensive than input.  

On the same page, GPT-5.2 pro input is $21.00 per 1M.  
GPT-5.2 pro output is $168.00 per 1M.  
Long outputs can connect directly to the cost structure.  

In an Anthropic example, Claude Opus 4.6 input is $5 per million tokens.  
Claude Opus 4.6 output is $25 per million tokens.  
The page also includes “up to 90% savings with prompt caching.”  
It also includes “50% savings with batch processing.”  

On the OpenAI pricing page, cached input is $0.175 per 1M tokens.  
That page also mentions “50% savings” with the Batch API.  
Iterative revisions can increase the value of caching and batching.

## Analysis

Plausible-looking code can hide later operating costs.  
Design consistency issues can trigger new revision requests.  
Each revision can add more output.  

If output unit prices are higher, output tokens can matter more.  
That is consistent with the pricing examples above.  

Value-for-price may depend on more than one-shot quality.  
It can also depend on behaviors during iteration.  

- (1) The ability to suggest missing elements early can reduce dialogue turns.  
- (2) The ability to resolve ambiguity can reduce follow-up questions.  
- (3) Brief summaries and minimal diffs can reduce output size.  

These remain criteria, not proven tool differences.  
Tool-level differences may require experiments or benchmarks.  

There are limitations.  
The verifiable facts here are the documented prices and discounts.  
This text does not show which tools use which models.  
This text also does not show which IDE features are applied.  

Clear requirements can help, but they also take time.  
Users may not start with a full spec.  
Bottlenecks can reflect process design as well as model behavior.

## Practical application

Official guidance often emphasizes clear instructions and iteration measurement.  
For frontend work, constraints can reduce guesswork during revisions.  
You can set typography, color, spacing, and component states early.  
You can also set cross-page consistency rules early.  

This text does not confirm an official template for acceptance criteria.  
That part may need additional confirmation.  

Cost control can focus on output length, not only fewer turns.  
Pricing examples show output rates above input rates in several cases.  
GPT-5.2 shows $14.000 output versus $1.750 input per 1M tokens.  
GPT-5.2 pro shows $168.00 output versus $21.00 input per 1M tokens.  
Some docs also mention 50% Batch API savings and caching options.  

So operating rules can target output length.  
You can request diffs instead of full rewrites.  
You can standardize a short summary format.  
You can group repeated instructions for caching or batching where supported.  

**Checklist for Today:**
- Write design tokens and consistency rules, and ask the tool to follow them in later edits.  
- Set the response format to “short change summary + minimal patch” to limit output length.  
- Check your platform’s documentation for caching or batching, and use it for repeated instructions.

## FAQ

**Q1. Why can revision cost drop if the model is better?**  
A. Revision loops can drift into long outputs.  
Some tools may catch missing elements early.  
Some tools may reduce ambiguity and follow-ups.  
Some tools may keep outputs patch-focused.  
Differences across tools may still need validation.  

**Q2. What is a common pitfall in token costs?**  
A. Output can be priced higher than input in some examples.  
GPT-5.2 shows $14.000 output per 1M versus $1.750 input per 1M.  
GPT-5.2 pro shows $168.00 output per 1M.  
Long “code + explanation + re-explanation” can raise output volume.  

**Q3. “Write prompts well” feels vague. What is a minimum set?**  
A. The documented principle is to give clear instructions.  
For a portfolio site, you can fix design constraints first.  
You can list key components and sections.  
You can define consistency rules across pages.  
You can set a response format like “summary + patch.”  
This text does not confirm an official acceptance-test template.

## Conclusion

Productivity can hinge on revision loops, not first drafts.  
Revision loops can increase output volume and cost.  

Pricing examples show output priced above input in several cases.  
Examples include $14.000 per 1M output and $168.00 per 1M output.  
Docs also mention cached input at $0.175 per 1M tokens.  
Docs also mention 50% batch savings language.  

A reasonable next step can be workflow design, not only tool choice.  
Aim to control output length during iterative edits.
