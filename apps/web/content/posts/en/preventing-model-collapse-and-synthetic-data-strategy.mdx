## TL;DR
- **Core Issue:** As high-quality data is expected to be depleted.
AI training methodologies are shifting toward inference-time computation and the utilization of synthetic data.
- **Importance:** Unverified self-improvement risks "Model Collapse," where the distinctiveness of information vanishes, potentially stagnating the advancement of intelligence.
- **Execution Guide:** When using synthetic data for training.
Symbolic model synthesis and verification loops should be implemented to manage data contamination in real time.

Example: A researcher instructs a language model to self-correct and learn from its own code. Initially, performance appears to improve, but over time, the model begins to treat its own subtle logical errors as correct answers. Eventually, the model reaches a state where it generates only non-executable code.

## Current Status: The End of Data and New Scaling Laws
Analyses suggest that existing Scaling Laws are reaching their limits. With projections that high-quality web data will be exhausted between 2026 and 2032, companies are shifting focus from increasing training resource inputs to "Inference-time scaling," which enhances reasoning capabilities by increasing computation during inference. This is an attempt to implement "System 2 thinking," where the model internally plans and reviews before providing an answer.

Simultaneously, the use of synthetic data to replace human data has begun. Synthetic data generated by frameworks such as SynthLLM has emerged as an alternative, showing scalability similar to raw data. However, according to a study published in *Nature* in 2024 and an analysis released in January 2026 (arXiv:2601.05280), the recursive process of retraining on AI-generated data produces side effects. In particular, the phenomenon of "Entropy Decay" is causing "failure modes" where models lose data individuality and become trapped in specific patterns.

## Analysis: The Dilemma and Trade-offs of Self-Improvement
The feasibility of self-improving agents depends more on the sophistication of software design than on hardware specifications. "Variance Amplification," which occurs when a model uses its own output as training data, accelerates the collapse of intelligence.

**1. Asymmetry Between Hardware Expansion and Intelligence**
The completion of a data center does not immediately signify the birth of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). While hardware help ensure computational speed, it cannot function as a filter to screen out logical errors within a model. Although it is unlikely that self-improving coding agents will be delayed by hardware limitations, the "Model Collapse" resulting from learning flawed data acts as a bottleneck on the path to AGI.

**2. Alternative Paradigm: Symbolic Model Synthesis**
Symbolic Model Synthesis is being proposed to overcome the limitations of statistical learning. This approach combines probabilistic generation with symbolic logic. Establishing a structure to verify logical consistency between data—rather than simply increasing the volume of training data—becomes the key condition for a qualitative leap in intelligence.

## Practical Application: Strategies to Break Through Intellectual Stagnation
Developers and decision-makers should focus on sophisticated loop design rather than just model size. The challenge lies in maintaining data purity when building self-improvement systems.

**Checklist for Today:**
- Install monitoring tools in the training pipeline to measure the mixing ratio of synthetic and real data and track changes in entropy.
- Apply inference-time computation algorithms that allow the model to self-verify errors before outputting an answer.
- Integrate static analysis tools or symbolic verifiers into the loop to validate the logical integrity of generated data.

## FAQ
**Q: How can Model Collapse be prevented?**
A: Avoid simple recursive learning and maintain a certain percentage of human data in the training set, or selectively expose the model only to synthetic data that has undergone symbolic verification. According to 2026 research, hybrid synthesis methods are necessary to prevent entropy decay.

**Q: Is inference-time scaling more efficient than training-stage scaling?**
A: It can be advantageous in data-exhaustion scenarios. In environments where training data cannot be increased indefinitely, methods that leverage existing intelligence to think more deeply are better suited for improving logical problem-solving skills.

**Q: Isn't hardware performance the decisive variable for reaching AGI?**
A: Hardware is the infrastructure. Even if chip manufacturing technology and power supply are supported, intelligence is likely to stagnate at a certain point if the model architecture fails to solve the entropy decay problem inherent in recursive learning.

## Conclusion
The path to AGI depends on how we control model collapse occurring during the self-improvement process, moving beyond the mere expansion of infrastructure. Future technical competition will be determined not just by server capacity, but by the ability to implant a logically complete "System 2" reasoning framework into models. Hybrid architectures and sophisticated data curation are expected to become the standards replacing simple scaling.
