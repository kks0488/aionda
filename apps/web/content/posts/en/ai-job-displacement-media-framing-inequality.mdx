# Media Framing of the AI Substitution Discourse: Presumed Threats and Hidden Inequalities

The discourse that AI will take our jobs has become a familiar future prediction. However, when this discourse is propagated through the media as an 'established fact,' we tend to focus on simplified anxieties rather than the complex socioeconomic impacts of technological change. Research points out that this framing can be disconnected from actual data and may instead foster a climate of blaming new entrants, potentially exacerbating existing inequalities.

## Current Status: Investigated Facts and Data

According to Goldman Sachs' 2023 analysis, 44% of legal tasks and 35% of financial and accounting tasks have the potential to be automated by AI. The World Economic Forum selected simple accounting and bookkeeping roles as the jobs expected to decline the fastest within the next five years. PwC's 2025 survey showed that the productivity growth rate in finance and professional services industries, which have high AI exposure, was 27%, three times higher than the 9% in low-exposure industries.

On the other hand, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' employment outlook predicts that the overall employment levels for accountants and lawyers will grow by 5.8% and 8%, respectively, by 2033. This suggests that AI is not eliminating entire occupations but rather replacing simple, repetitive tasks and transforming the nature of jobs toward higher-value work. No substantial official government statistics have been confirmed that attribute a decline in professional employment solely to AI adoption.

An analysis of AI reporting frames in major domestic and international media reveals that the 'opportunity/complement' discourse overwhelmingly outweighs the 'threat/substitution' discourse. Research indicates that optimistic frames emphasizing economic growth and social development account for approximately 60-70%, while frames addressing job displacement risks remain at around 20-30%.

## Analysis: Meaning and Impact

When the media exaggerates AI adoption as a *fait accompli* and leads with optimistic frames, several problems arise. First, the uncertainty and gradual nature of technological change are obscured. Second, the actual difficulties faced by victims of this change, such as lower-level clerical workers, may not receive adequate attention. Third, there is a risk of fostering a social atmosphere that blames individuals or new entrants who struggle to adapt to technological change for their 'lack of capability.'

Economic indicators support this possibility of deepening inequality. The Bank of Korea and KDI analyze the potential for productivity improvement in high-skilled, high-wage occupations and income decline in low-skilled occupations through occupation-specific 'AI exposure-complementarity' indicators. At a macro level, changes in the labor share of income are becoming a key monitoring metric. The actual beneficiaries of technological change are likely to be existing vested interests who can leverage new technology as capital, which could intensify socioeconomic inequality.

## Practical Application: Methods Readers Can Utilize

A critical attitude is needed when accepting the AI discourse conveyed by the media. Scrutinize the context of statistics presented in reports, especially future forecast figures. 'Automation of task units' and 'disappearance of occupations' are clearly distinct concepts. Paying attention to the new roles AI creates and the changes in required competencies is a more useful response strategy than being swept up in simple substitution fears.

Individuals can deconstruct their own jobs into task units and distinguish between repetitive tasks most vulnerable to AI and creative/strategic tasks whose value could increase when complemented by AI. Organizations and policymakers must consider retraining and income redistribution mechanisms to ensure that the benefits of productivity gains are not concentrated in specific groups.

## FAQ

**Q: Is AI actually reducing jobs for accountants or lawyers?**
A: Current official employment statistics actually forecast growth in employment for these professions. AI is not replacing entire occupations but is automating specific tasks like simple document processing or data organization, thereby changing the nature of the jobs.

**Q: Why does the media emphasize the opportunities of AI more than the threats?**
A: Framing technological advancement positively is advantageous for promoting innovation and attracting investment. Furthermore, in the early stages of technology adoption, interest in practical applications and economic benefits is naturally high. However, there is a risk that potential negative impacts may be overlooked.

**Q: What is the basis for the claim that AI exacerbates inequality?**
A: Analyses indicate that while AI increases the productivity of high-skilled, high-wage occupations, it threatens the jobs and incomes of low-skilled occupations. A major concern is that the income gap may widen between those who own technology as capital and those who rely on simple labor.

## Conclusion

The AI substitution discourse is a matter of social perception shaped more by media framing than by the objective impact of the technology. We must strike a balance between optimism and fear. Verified data shows transformation of jobs rather than their disappearance, and the risk of widening inequality rather than an absolute threat. The true challenge lies in reaching a social consensus on how to fairly distribute the fruits of the productivity gains AI will bring and how to protect groups vulnerable to change.
