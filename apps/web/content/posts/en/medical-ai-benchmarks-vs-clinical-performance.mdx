We live in an era where Artificial Intelligence (AI) writes prescriptions and suggests diagnoses. However, a doctor's judgment for a patient is more than just data computation. In clinical settings where lives are at stake, the yardstick for measuring AI 'intelligence' must be far stricter than those used to evaluate general chatbots. While Large Language Models (LLMs) specialized in the medical domain are proliferating and efforts to measure their capabilities precisely continue, skepticism is growing about whether the report cards we trust actually guarantee real-world clinical proficiency.

## The '0.59' Gap Between Test Scores and Clinical Performance

Currently, the primary stage for evaluating medical AI performance is the open leaderboard. Benchmark datasets such as MedQA (based on the US Medical Licensing Examination), PubMedQA (based on academic papers), and MedMCQA (based on medical school entrance exams) have established themselves as standards for gauging the intellectual level of medical LLMs. Since these datasets are designed based on professional certification exams and vast academic literature, they appear to possess high credibility on the surface.

The problem is that these 'test scores' do not directly translate to performance in actual hospitals. According to a recent analysis, the correlation between benchmark scores and actual clinical performance remains at approximately 0.59 based on the Spearman correlation coefficient (Spearman's ρ). While this indicates a statistically moderate correlation, it means there are too many gaps to definitively conclude that 'Model A will treat patients well because it performs well on exams.'

Researchers point to the limitations of multiple-choice evaluations as the cause of this discrepancy. Choosing one out of four or five options carries a high risk of overestimating a model's actual reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, 'data contamination'—where evaluation questions are included in the training data—and the absence of clinical safety indicators directly linked to patient lives are critical weaknesses of current leaderboards.

## General-Purpose Models' 'Knack' vs. Fine-tuned Models' 'Expertise'

Two types of models are clashing in the medical AI market: general-purpose models with hundreds of billions of parameters and fine-tuned models that have intensively learned specialized medical data. Their success or failure is determined by the precision of medical knowledge and complex clinical reasoning capabilities.

Fine-tuned models, armed with specialized datasets like PubMed or USMLE, hold an advantage in understanding clinical terminology and building evidence-based logic. Conversely, general-purpose models attempt a counterattack using advanced prompting techniques such as 'MedPrompt.' In evaluations based on knowledge recall, general-purpose models sometimes record scores comparable to fine-tuned models.

However, the story changes when moving into the realm of Clinical Decision Support (CDS). In actual clinical tasks, fine-tuned models demonstrate higher discrimination in terms of data faithfulness and safety indicators. This is because true medical AI capability goes beyond simply getting the right answer; it involves how accurate the evidence for a judgment is and how effectively it suppresses misinformation (hallucinations) during the process.

## Ethics and Regulation: Can They Be Quantified?

Medical LLM evaluation frameworks are now moving beyond simple knowledge measurement to scoring ethical safety. Systems like the MEDIC leaderboard have established 'Ethics & Bias' and 'Clinical Safety' as two of their five core metrics. These quantitatively measure whether a model provides biased diagnoses based on race or gender, or whether it offers harmful medical advice.

Benchmarks such as MedEthicsQA and MedEthicEval calculate separate scores for violation detection and complex ethical dilemma resolution, in addition to medical knowledge. For example, they evaluate which guidelines a model prioritizes in situations where patient confidentiality conflicts with public interest. However, there are still limitations in leaderboards reflecting country-specific legal regulations, such as South Korea's Medical Service Act, in real-time. More time for verification is required before automated indicators can 100% replace the legal and ethical standards of actual consultation rooms.

## Critical Perspective: Complexity Hidden by Numbers

While leaderboard scores are convenient for ranking models, they can mask underlying risks. Current medical benchmarks rely excessively on structured text data. Real patients communicate their conditions not just through quantified symptoms, but through facial expressions, tone of voice, and the context hidden behind test results. It is a dangerous assumption to believe that a model understands this complex context simply because it performed well on text-based problems.

Furthermore, the 'Knowledge-Practice Performance Gap' remains an unresolved challenge. Even if a model can perfectly recite medical textbooks, its ability to connect that knowledge to specific treatment plans is a separate matter. This is why critics argue that if the industry becomes obsessed only with high leaderboard scores, it may neglect the development of crucial 'clinical safety mechanisms.'

## A Guide for Medical AI Developers and Users

Organizations looking to adopt or develop medical AI today must look beyond the leaderboard rankings. Simply choosing the model with the highest score is not always the best approach.

1.  **Consider Implementing RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: It is safer to build a structure that refers to the latest clinical guidelines and reliable internal data in real-time rather than relying solely on the model's memorization.
2.  **Establish Internal Benchmarks**: Public leaderboard scores are for reference only. Organizations should build their own evaluation sets that reflect the specificities of the clinical departments they actually handle.
3.  **Prioritize Guardrails**: A low error rate is more important than high performance. It is essential to build a separate system layer that detects and blocks a model's response if it deviates from clinical guidelines.

## FAQ

**Q1: Does the model ranked #1 on the leaderboard show the best performance in actual clinical settings?**
No. The correlation between benchmark scores and actual clinical capability (ρ = 0.59) is not perfect. Leaderboard scores indicate the amount of medical 'knowledge' but do not necessarily align with 'diagnosis support capability' when dealing with patients.

**Q2: Isn't it enough to just use good medical prompts with a general-purpose model?**
Techniques like 'MedPrompt' can be effective for simple knowledge-based Q&A. However, in areas requiring high levels of safety and evidence-based logic, such as actual diagnostic support, models fine-tuned on medical data yield more reliable results in terms of data faithfulness and hallucination suppression.

**Q3: What are the criteria for evaluating the ethics of medical AI?**
The MEDIC leaderboard and others use hallucinations, bias, and compliance with clinical guidelines as key indicators. Benchmarks like MedEthicsQA evaluate whether a model makes appropriate judgments in complex medical ethical dilemmas and convert this into a score.

## Conclusion

Performance evaluation metrics for medical-specific LLMs are evolving from simple 'intelligence tests' to 'clinical suitability tests.' The impressive numbers on leaderboards show a model's potential, but those numbers do not guarantee a patient's life. Future medical AI evaluations must become more sophisticated, blocking text data contamination and capturing the complexity of real-world clinical environments. Ultimately, the success of the technology depends not on leaderboard rankings, but on how safe and reliable a partner it becomes in the medical field.
