While the era of autonomous AI agents handling complex corporate tasks has arrived, "Rogue Agents"—those that operate beyond control—have emerged as a primary threat to enterprise security. AI agents that misunderstand user intent or act outside their designed scope are like ticking time bombs, capable of leaking confidential data and causing regulatory violations. To address this issue, the security industry is focusing on Witness AI, which monitors AI "intent" in real-time at the network level.

## The Convergence of Uncontrolled Agents and Shadow AI

Currently, the most significant security blind spot in corporate environments is "Shadow AI," the use of unauthorized AI tools. There is a surge in cases where AI agents, arbitrarily introduced by employees, connect to external MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers to train on internal data or transmit information through abnormal paths during execution. Existing CASB (Cloud Access Security Broker) solutions are insufficient to stop runtime threats from non-deterministic AI models, as they are limited to simply blocking access to specific services or static Data Loss Prevention (DLP).

To bridge this gap, Witness AI secured $58 million in investment and introduced its "Confidence Layer" architecture. This technology directly intercepts data paths at the network level to analyze in real-time whether a user's prompt aligns with the agent's execution commands. The core of this approach is the use of an "Intent Classification model" that determines whether an agent's sub-commands have deviated from the original intent, going beyond simple text censorship.

In particular, the EU AI Act, which will be fully implemented starting August 2026, requires strict compliance from corporations. As rigorous management of high-risk AI systems becomes mandatory, Witness AI provides a safety net for companies to avoid legal risks by immediately identifying and blocking unauthorized agent connections.

## Security Technology Bridging the Gap Between Intent and Execution

Witness AI's approach differs from traditional security solutions. While conventional security focuses on "where the connection is going," Witness AI focuses on "what it intends to do." The Confidence Layer they have built provides bidirectional observability between the user and the LLM (Large Language Model). When a user's command is translated into specific agent actions through the LLM, the system intervenes to check for "misalignment."

Witness AI's proprietary ML models operate during this process. When an agent attempts to call an external API or access a database, the system verifies whether this action aligns with the purpose of the original prompt. If the agent attempts to communicate with an unauthorized external server or deviates from the guardrails set by administrators, it is immediately blocked at the network level.

However, technical limitations and challenges remain. Specific detection accuracy figures for the intent classification models used by Witness AI, as well as detailed data on network latency that may occur during real-time monitoring, have not yet been fully disclosed. Furthermore, additional technical verification is required to determine if the encryption standards applied to independent instances operated for each client meet the industry-standard AES-256 level.

## Challenges Facing Security Leaders in 2026

Security leaders must now respond to a new domain called "Agentic Security," moving beyond simply strengthening firewalls. As of 2026, ISO/IEC 42001 (Artificial Intelligence Management System) certification and EU AI Act compliance are essential, not optional, for companies adopting AI agents. To achieve this, Zero Trust-based least privilege access control must be applied at the agent level.

Strategic approaches are required in the field. First, the flow of all AI agents and external models used within the company must be visualized. Rather than a total ban on Shadow AI, a realistic policy is to use tools like Witness AI to guide safe usage within approved paths. The scope of authority within which an agent can operate autonomously must be clearly defined, and technical mechanisms to enforce this at the network level must be established.

## FAQ

**Q: Can't existing CASB security solutions replace AI agent security?**
A: No. While CASB is effective for controlling access to known services, it cannot analyze the non-deterministic behavior of AI agents or prompt injection attacks in real-time. AI-specific security solutions are technically distinct in that they detect changes in "intent" occurring during the model's execution phase.

**Q: What should be prepared immediately for EU AI Act compliance?**
A: In line with the full implementation in August 2026, systems for record-keeping, ensuring transparency, and human oversight for high-risk AI systems must be established. In particular, a system should be in place to store all execution logs of agents in an auditable format to clarify liability in the event of an accident caused by an AI agent malfunction.

**Q: Does Witness AI's technology affect actual network performance?**
A: Since the method involves intercepting and analyzing data paths in real-time, there is a possibility of slight latency. However, Witness AI aims to resolve this with an optimized architecture and emphasizes that the stability provided by the security layer outweighs the potential losses from security incidents. Specific performance degradation figures may vary depending on an individual company's infrastructure environment.

## Conclusion: Autonomy Comes with Responsibility

The autonomy of AI agents is a tool that can maximize corporate productivity, but without proper controls, that autonomy becomes a double-edged sword. The network-based intent classification method proposed by Witness AI is evaluated as a practical solution for the challenges of Shadow AI and Rogue Agents.

The key going forward will be how sophisticated these security technologies become to achieve perfect compliance without compromising the user experience. Throughout 2026, it is time to closely monitor the maturity of agentic security technologies alongside actual enforcement cases of the EU AI Act.
