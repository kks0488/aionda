## TL;DR
- Google Threat Intelligence published an AI Threat Tracker framing adversarial AI use around distillation, experimentation, and continued integration.
- AWS highlighted NVIDIA Nemotron 3 Nano 30B MoE availability in SageMaker JumpStart and shared a practical guide to Amazon Bedrock throttling and service availability.
- OpenAI discussed “harness engineering” with Codex in an agent-first world, alongside renewed attention on open-source agent/RAG/inference/OCR/web-data tooling.

This post is a link archive based on materials collected over the last 24h. It is meant to help you jump into primary sources quickly.

## Official Updates
- 🛡️ [GTIG AI Threat Tracker: Distillation, Experimentation, and (Continued) Integration of AI for Adversarial Use](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/distillation-experimentation-integration-ai-adversarial-use/) — Google Threat Intelligence (Mandiant)
- Why it matters.
It’s worth reading for a threat-centric structure of how adversaries adopt AI—from distillation to experimentation to operational integration.
- 🏛️ [NVIDIA Nemotron 3 Nano 30B MoE model is now available in Amazon SageMaker JumpStart](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/nvidia-nemotron-3-nano-30b-is-now-available-in-amazon-sagemaker-jumpstart/) — AWS Machine Learning Blog
  - Why it matters: It documents, from an official source, that NVIDIA Nemotron 3 Nano 30B MoE is available via Amazon SageMaker JumpStart.

- Why it matters.
It positions itself as an open-source RAG engine blending RAG with agent capabilities, offering a comparison point for retrieval stacks.
- ⚠️ [redis/redis — For developers, who are building real-time data-driven applications, Redis is the preferred, fastest, and most feature-…](https://github.com/redis/redis) — GitHub Search (rag)
- Why it matters.
As a widely used real-time data store, it’s relevant background for designing caching/state layers in RAG and agent systems.
- ⚠️ [lobehub/lobehub — The ultimate space for work and life — to find, build, and collaborate with agent teammates that grow with you. We are …](https://github.com/lobehub/lobehub) — GitHub Search (mcp)
  - Why it matters: It’s aimed at building and collaborating with agent ‘teammates,’ which is useful for exploring multi-agent workspace patterns.
- ⚠️ [ggml-org/llama.cpp — LLM inference in C/C++](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp) — GitHub Search (llm)
  - Why it matters: It’s a core C/C++ LLM inference project, useful when assessing local or edge inference approaches.
- ⚠️ [PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR — Turn any PDF or image document into structured data for your AI. A powerful, lightweight OCR toolkit that bridges the g…](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR) — GitHub Search (rag)
  - Why it matters: It turns PDFs/images into structured data, directly supporting document ingestion pipelines for RAG.
- ⚠️ [firecrawl/firecrawl — 🔥 The Web Data API for AI - Turn entire websites into LLM-ready markdown or structured data](https://github.com/firecrawl/firecrawl) — GitHub Search (llm)
- Why it matters.
It offers an API to convert entire websites into LLM-ready markdown or structured data, simplifying web ingestion for AI apps.

## Practical Application
**Checklist for Today:**
- Security teams should map internal risk reviews to GTIG’s distillation/experimentation/integration lens for adversarial AI use.
- Platform teams should update runbooks using the Bedrock throttling and availability guide to improve request control and operational resilience.
- Engineering teams should shortlist PoCs combining JumpStart model options with tools like gemini-cli, llama.cpp, RAGFlow, and Firecrawl.
