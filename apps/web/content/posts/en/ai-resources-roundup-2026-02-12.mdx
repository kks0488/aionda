- Curated links from recently collected materials (official sources first).
- Optimized for fast scanning: open the source and take notes for your use-case.
- Treat this as an index, not a substitute for reading the original.

This post is a link archive based on materials collected over the last 24h. It is meant to help you jump into primary sources quickly.
