The answer to the question "What is the smartest AI model?" has changed. (Problem)
On November 24, 2025, Anthropic set a new standard for AI intelligence with the release of **Claude Opus 4.5**. (Solution)
This model overwhelms existing top models in all benchmarks, demonstrating unique performance especially in **professional software engineering** and **complex agent tasks**. (Evidence)

## What's Amazing About Opus 4.5

### 1. Performance Up, Price Down
Usually, when performance goes up, price goes up. However, Opus 4.5 is priced at **1/3 of the previous generation Opus 3**. This signifies a huge technical advance in model architecture and inference efficiency.

### 2. Programmatic Tool Calling
Opus 4.5 can **call tools directly within the code execution environment (Programmatic Tool Calling)**. This enables seamless integration where the AI writes Python code, calls an external API if necessary, and stores the result back in a code variable for calculation.

### 3. Effort Parameter
Users can adjust the AI's 'effort level' according to the importance of the task.
- `effort: "low"`: Fast drafting
- `effort: "high"`: Deep analysis and cross-verification

## Comparison with Competitors
Opus 4.5 competes directly with OpenAI's GPT 5.2 series and still maintains Claude's unique strengths, especially in **Long Context understanding** and **grasping nuances**. Opus 4.5 is likely to be preferred for tasks requiring literary creativity or ethical judgment.
