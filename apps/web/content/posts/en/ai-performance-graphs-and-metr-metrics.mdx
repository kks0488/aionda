## TL;DR
- Evaluation standards are shifting from simple accuracy scores to metrics that measure autonomous problem-solving capabilities.
- Relying on benchmark scores alone creates risks for practical performance and safety management.
- Decision-makers should evaluate models by checking autonomous capability data and third-party safety assessments.

Example: Imagine conference rooms where executives view graphs showing steep upward curves. They feel encouraged by high test scores and plan to adopt models. Yet, nobody can explain if the models can organize complex files. Nobody knows if they can manage practical workflows without human help. This scenario shows the gap between scores and reality.

Traditional AI performance graphs may no longer reflect how models handle real-world tasks. Criticism regarding AI evaluation methods is increasing. The METR (Model Evaluation and Threat Research) metric evaluates how models perform complex tasks independently. It is becoming a common standard for measuring intelligence.

## Current Status
AI evaluation is moving away from a focus on accuracy rates. The METR metric measures the ability to achieve goals independently. METR specializes in evaluating autonomous capabilities like executing code without human help. 

Many graphs show results for specific datasets. This makes it hard to see if a model is smarter or just memorized the test. Experts focus on actual executable capabilities rather than stored knowledge. 

Third-party agencies monitor whether models cross safety thresholds. They look for risks like autonomous cyberattacks or self-replication.

## Analysis
Performance graphs can cause misunderstanding due to fragmented intelligence. High benchmark scores may not mean a model works well for all tasks. A model good at math might fail at software design. 

Rising curves do not necessarily lead to higher productivity. Some people question the scaling law. Performance might not improve proportionally with more computation in real environments. 

METR metrics help verify true capabilities by removing performance exaggerations. Some companies use benchmarks as marketing tools. They might show favorable metrics or adjust graph axes to emphasize growth. This can hide technical limits and create high expectations.

## Practical Application
Decision-makers should study measurement methods instead of just looking at graph slopes. Identifying model errors during autonomous tasks is helpful.

**Checklist for Today:**
- Review whether the model has undergone autonomous capability evaluations from organizations like METR.
- Examine the reasoning process of the model to verify its logical consistency.
- Setup scenarios like your work environment to see if the model can correct its own errors.

## FAQ
**Q: How does METR differ from existing benchmarks?**
A: Existing methods are like theory exams, while METR is a practical exam. It gives models goals and evaluates their independent use of tools.

**Q: Can sharp rises in performance be trusted?**
A: You should check if the rise comes from specific data or general skills. Compare measurement units and conditions to ensure fairness.

**Q: Is high autonomous capability often positive?**
A: Higher capabilities can increase the risk of misuse or loss of control. Review safety mechanisms alongside performance data.

## Conclusion
AI graphs show only one side of the technology. You should look past visual curves to understand data complexity and autonomy limits. Choose models that can solve real-world problems independently. The market can move toward intelligence that is both measurable and trustworthy.
