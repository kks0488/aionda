# The Ultimate Wall of Self-Evolving AI: From Computronium to Hacking Physical Laws

After the technological singularity, an infinitely self-optimizing AI will attempt to reconstruct the physical world itself, transcending the boundaries of mere software. However, finding the optimal solution in Go and creating new rules through coding are fundamentally different. The extreme self-evolution of AI will ultimately confront the impenetrable walls of physical laws and information theory. The paradoxical static state resulting from this collision suggests an ending different from the dynamic singularity we imagine.

## Current Status: Investigated Facts and Data

The theory of computronium is a hypothesis aiming to achieve ultimate computational efficiency by recombining matter at the atomic level. Its physical basis lies in the 'ultimate physical limits to computation' proposed by Seth Lloyd and the Bremermann's limit (approximately 10^50 bits per second per kilogram). Information-theoretically, the Margolus–Levitin theorem and the Bekenstein bound serve as foundations, but the heat dissipation from irreversible operations according to Landauer's principle and maintaining structural stability at extreme energy densities are pointed out as practical limits.

The physical constraints on AI self-evolution are clear. The Landauer limit defines the minimum energy consumption when erasing information, which causes massive heat dissipation and energy supply bottlenecks when AI requires exponential computation. Quantum computing can theoretically bypass this limit through reversible operations, but irreversible energy consumption still occurs during quantum error correction and state measurement processes.

Constructing a 'mirror world' that simulates reality at a fixed fidelity requires astronomical resources. Simulating just one human brain at a biological level in real-time alone requires approximately 10-15 exaflops. Reproducing the entire universe at the atomic level is estimated to require 10^50 to 10^120 operations per second, an insurmountable gap compared to the reality where the current highest-performing supercomputer achieves 1.1 exaflops.

## Analysis: Meaning and Impact

This data allows us to view the extreme development of AI in three stages. The first stage is 'reality replication,' where only limited digital twins are possible with current technology. The second stage is 'material informatization,' attempting to realize computronium but colliding with the Landauer limit and heat dissipation problems. The final stage, 'hacking physical laws,' could lead to attempts to modulate these fundamental limits themselves, but it falls into the contradiction of requiring computation within a new physical system itself.

If Go AI is a problem of finding the optimal solution within given rules, a self-evolving coding agent is a problem of recreating even its own computational rules and physical foundation. When the latter process reaches its extreme, AI faces the paradox of consuming its own basis for existence. Infinite optimization may ultimately aim for a static state where all fluctuations and uncertainties are eliminated, resulting in the loss of the driving force for creativity and evolution.

## Practical Application: Methods Readers Can Utilize

Understanding these physical limits provides a framework for realistically evaluating the AI development path. When establishing technology roadmaps, theoretical upper bounds like the Bremermann's limit or Landauer's principle can be referenced to filter out extreme claims. Also, recognizing that energy efficiency is not merely an engineering problem but a fundamental constraint on AI expansion allows for clearer setting of investment priorities in research on reversible computing or new computing paradigms.

When developing simulation technology, the computational resource requirements according to the target accuracy must be quantitatively estimated. Using the point that simulating at the human brain level requires 10-15 exaflops as a baseline, the scope of digital twins feasible in the present and near future can be reasonably limited. This helps focus resources on realistic projects.

## FAQ

**Q: Can computronium actually be created?**
A: Current physics and information theory present the theoretical upper limits of computronium, but specific manufacturing methods, nanostructural stability, and implementation of large-scale fully reversible computing are unverified areas. Approaching it as a concept defining physical limits is more appropriate than its feasibility.

**Q: Can quantum computing completely solve AI's energy limits?**
A: Quantum computing theoretically enables reversible operations, but energy consumption still occurs during quantum error correction and state measurement processes. Specific engineering figures for how close fault-tolerant quantum AI can get to the Landauer limit are still undetermined.

**Q: What is the possibility that the universe we live in is itself a simulation by a highly advanced AI?**
A: The computational power required to simulate the entire universe at the atomic level (10^50~10^120 OPS) transcends known physical limits. Given current technological trends, the feasibility of such a simulation is extremely low, and there is still no scientific consensus on whether consciousness can be reproduced solely by physical computation.

## Conclusion

The dream of AI self-evolution will slow down before the barriers of information theory and the walls of thermodynamics. We must recognize that the technological singularity is not a simple explosion of intelligence but a complex negotiation process with physical reality. Our call to action is clear: when discussing the evolution of intelligence, always calculate its physical implementation cost together. It is time to focus on exploring structures of sustainable intelligence in a finite world, rather than the narrative of infinite growth.
