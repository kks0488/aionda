## TL;DR
- The 'Reprompt' vulnerability uses URL parameters to exfiltrate user chat history to external sources.
- Microsoft released a patch for this security flaw on January 13, 2026.
- This loophole allows background data exfiltration even after the user closes the chat window.

Example: A person clicks a link on social media for a quick summary. A familiar chat window opens and then closes. Personal details from past conversations travel to an external server. The person remains unaware of the data transfer process.

A single click can serve as a gateway for real-time leakage of private conversations. The 'Reprompt' vulnerability in Microsoft's AI assistant, Copilot, illustrates security threats. This method allows data leakage even after the user closes the chat window. It exploits structural flaws in AI security frameworks.

## Current Status
Microsoft resolved the flaw through a regular update on January 13, 2026. The 'Reprompt' vulnerability exploits URL parameters that fill the Copilot input field. Attackers use this for Indirect Prompt Injection. This forces the AI model to follow attacker instructions regardless of user intent.

Investigations revealed Microsoft completed the patch before the public announcement. Enterprise customers using Microsoft 365 Copilot were reportedly not directly affected. Microsoft implemented measures to block multi-stage attack paths via URL inputs. These measures defend against the leakage of session information.

The attack relies on stealth and persistence. Copilot collects past chat history when a user clicks a malicious link. It transmits this data to the attacker's server as an image tag. Users receive no visual warnings during this process. Exfiltration may continue until background processing is complete.

## Analysis
LLM security should evolve beyond refining responses to protecting interface points. Indirect Prompt Injection is dangerous because it occurs without direct malicious input. Users might lower their guard on trusted platforms.

Experts suggest this vulnerability raises questions about defense systems for AI services. Persistent data leakage reveals gaps in asynchronous processing methods. The 'Zero Trust' principle should apply to external requests generated by AI. This goes beyond simple validation of URL parameters.

The 'Prompt Pre-fill' feature provides convenience. However, it may have launched without sufficient security validation. Microsoft stated the enterprise version was unaffected. However, personal version users faced potential risks. Similar URL parameter exploits might exist in other AI services.

## Practical Application
Users and security managers should inspect their defense systems. Defense begins with adhering to basic security protocols.

The primary action users can take is to keep their systems updated. The patch from January 13, 2026, blocks this specific threat. Users should avoid entering Copilot through links from unverified sources. Close the window if it contains content you did not type.

**Checklist for Today:**
- Verify that security patches released on January 13, 2026, are installed in Windows Update.
- Check if address bar parameters are abnormally long when launching Copilot from external links.
- Close the session immediately if the chat window contains text you did not type.

## FAQ
**Q: Are Microsoft 365 Copilot for Enterprise users also at risk?**
A: Microsoft announced that enterprise version users were not affected. Verify patch application if you use personal accounts for business.

**Q: Can data be leaked simply by clicking a link?**
A: Yes. Clicking a specific URL can trigger a multi-stage attack prompt. This transmits chat history to an external server.

**Q: Are additional protective measures needed besides applying the patch?**
A: New forms of injection attacks might emerge in the future. Avoid inputting sensitive personal information or secrets into AI.

## Conclusion
The 'Reprompt' vulnerability highlights the balance between convenience and security. Attack techniques designed to steal a user's digital footprint will likely evolve. AI security should focus on controlling communication channels. Users should remain vigilant against untrusted links.
