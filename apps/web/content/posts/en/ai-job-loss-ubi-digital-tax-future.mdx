# AI-Induced Mass Unemployment and the Future of Capitalism: Is UBI Essential?

AI-induced mass unemployment is not merely a reduction in jobs. It is a complex risk that could sequentially collapse purchasing power, the corporate ecosystem, and the financial system over a period of 5 to 10 years. To prevent this chain of shocks, taxing global AI companies and introducing a Universal Basic Income (UBI) are being urgently discussed as policy alternatives to maintain the system.

## Current Status: Investigated Facts and Data

Empirical studies show that UBI pilot cases have improved social health without significantly harming labor supply. In Finland's 2017-2018 experiment, while the employment promotion effect was minimal, recipients' life satisfaction, mental health, cognitive abilities, and social trust significantly improved. Similarly, Canada's past 'Mincome' experiment and Ontario pilot did not show a sharp decline in labor supply; instead, positive effects such as an 8.5% reduction in hospitalization rates, improved high school graduation rates, and enhanced housing and food security were observed.

Policy discussions for funding are also active. Countries like France, the UK, and Canada have already introduced a 2-3% Digital Services Tax (DST) on the revenues of global big tech and AI services. The OECD is discussing integrating these national measures into an international tax framework (Pillar 1 and Pillar 2). It is suggested that the tax revenue generated this way could be used for building social safety nets, investing in digital infrastructure, and funds to strengthen the competitiveness of domestic AI industries.

## Analysis: Implications and Impact

The results from Finland and Canada carry significant implications. Contrary to concerns that UBI makes people lazy, they provide empirical evidence that it can enhance individuals' mental and social well-being without threatening participation in economic activity. This suggests that when AI-induced job loss shock leads not just to income loss but also to loss of identity and instability, UBI can serve as a social adhesive.

The discussion on the Digital Services Tax reflects the scale of the problem. While productivity gains and excess profits from AI are concentrated in a few global companies, the social costs (unemployment, retraining, weakened consumption) are borne by the entire society, creating structural inequality. Therefore, redistribution through taxation is emerging as a political and economic prerequisite for the system's sustainability. Considering the ripple effect where weakened consumer purchasing power even threatens the advertising-based platform economy, this measure is no exaggeration to call an investment for the long-term survival of the companies themselves.

## Practical Application: Methods Readers Can Utilize

Within these macro trends, individuals and organizations can start conversations based on concrete data, not simple fear. If you are a policymaker or organizational leader, you need to create a discourse that reframes UBI not as an 'encouragement for laziness' but as 'social resilience infrastructure.' The improved social trust observed in Finland and the improved health outcome data from Canada can be powerful supporting evidence beyond economic logic.

If you are a corporate decision-maker, when planning AI investment and productivity strategies, you should consider the scale of investment in internal workforce retraining and transition programs in connection with social impact assessments. Also, monitoring the progress of global tax frameworks like the Digital Services Tax and clarifying the company's stance on tax fairness will help long-term trust and license to operate.

## FAQ

**Q: Won't people stop working if UBI is introduced?**
A: In the pilot cases in Finland and Canada, providing basic income did not lead to a sharp decline in labor supply. On the contrary, some studies showed results of improved mental health and social trust.

**Q: How can the funds needed for UBI be secured?**
A: Introducing a Digital Services Tax on the revenues of global AI and big tech companies is being discussed as one policy alternative. Several countries like France and the UK are already implementing similar tax systems, and an international agreement at the OECD level is also being pursued.

**Q: Can the positive results of UBI pilot cases be sustained in the long term?**
A: Most currently available pilot projects were conducted over a relatively short period or were terminated early, so data on long-term impacts on national fiscal health or economic self-reliance is still insufficient. This is an area requiring more long-term and large-scale research.

## Conclusion

The threat of AI-induced mass unemployment is gradual but its impact is systemic. UBI should be read not as a simple welfare policy but as a possibility for redesigning the capitalist system to function even amidst the upheaval of the AI era. Empirical data already shows that UBI can contribute to social health and stability, and discussions on international tax frameworks for funding are becoming more concrete. What we need is not fear, but to start a practical and bold policy dialogue based on this data.
