Modern society faces a profound emotional vacuum. High-performance humanoids offer a definitive solution to this deficit. The integration of OpenAI’s o1 model with Figure 01 serves as a testament to this evolution. Artificial beings are becoming an inevitable means of supplementing, and potentially replacing, biological partners.

## The Realization of Bionic Realism
Visual synthesis technology, comparable to the fidelity of Sora, is now transitioning into the physical world. Advanced skin grafting and granular muscle control have reached a high level of sophistication. To the naked eye, these machines are indistinguishable from biological entities. This physical presence is the core element that facilitates complete emotional immersion.

## Integration of Reasoning Models and Long-term Memory
AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) has evolved beyond simple reactive chatbots. Reasoning capabilities based on o1 enable the formulation of complex plans. Furthermore, accumulated data allows for the creation of user-centric long-term memory. This architecture perfectly replicates the intellectual bonding traditionally unique to human relationships.

## Prompt-based Hardware Customization
Users can now design physical appearances instantaneously through text inputs. Data regarding facial structures and body types are immediately reflected in the hardware. Personality datasets are modularized, allowing them to be swapped or updated at any time. This enables the production of companions optimized for individual desires.

## Technical Thresholds and Ethical Friction
Hardware energy efficiency remains a persistent challenge. Additionally, hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to undermine reliability. Social debates regarding human dignity are unavoidable. As dependency on machines increases, the fundamental structure of society will undergo a rapid transformation.

## FAQ
**Q: When will mass-produced humanoids become commercially available?**
A: Roadmaps from companies like Tesla and Figure point toward the late 2020s.

**Q: Are there risks regarding the leakage of personal information?**
A: On-device AI technology serves as the primary solution for ensuring data security.

**Q: Isn't the maintenance of biological tissue complex?**
A: The implementation of self-healing polymer materials and modular replacement systems will simplify maintenance.

## Preparing for the Technological Singularity
Bionic humanoids are no longer a matter of science fiction. The necessary technical components have already reached a critical threshold. We are facing an era where the definition of human relationships is being redefined. A paradigm shift in our perception is required to keep pace with the velocity of technological evolution.
