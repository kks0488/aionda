Behind the fluent sentences and sophisticated outputs generated by artificial intelligence (AI) lies a vast swamp of data. We have long believed that more data and larger models were the answer. However, as of 2026, the industry's focus is shifting rapidly from "quantity" to "quality." Hallucinations and biases shown by models trained on low-quality data have emerged as ethical risks that shake a company's foundation beyond mere technical flaws. Now, data quality is not just a variable determining model performance but the sole foundation supporting AI reliability.

## The Value of 'Textbook-grade' Quality Retrieved from the Data Swamp

Recently, cases have emerged where Small Language Models (SLMs) trained on refined, high-quality data outperform the reasoning performance of large-scale models with trillions of parameters. This is the triumph of so-called "textbook-grade data." Unrefined data scraped from every corner of the internet poisons the model. AI trained on data mixed with low-quality short-form content and hate speech fails to understand complex logical structures and exhibits degraded reasoning capabilities.

Data governance systems are key mechanisms to prevent such performance degradation. Moving beyond simply collecting data, a system that manages data throughout the entire lifecycle of training, inference, and utilization substantially improves the model's multi-step reasoning performance and accuracy. In particular, "Context Rot" occurring during the inference stage is a primary culprit eroding operational efficiency. Sophisticated data curation helps preserve core reasoning capabilities even during model compression processes.

Technical verification to remove data bias is also being systematized. The international standard ISO/IEC 24027 and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF) provide strategies for measuring and mitigating bias across the AI lifecycle. In Korea, the Telecommunications Technology Association (TTA) operates the "AI Trustworthiness Certification and Testing (CAT) 2.0" system, enhanced based on international standards like ISO/IEC 42001, rigorously verifying bias response capabilities in real-world environments.

## Evolution of Synthetic Data and the Era of Multi-dimensional Evaluation

Synthetic Data, which emerged to solve data scarcity issues, has also entered a new phase. In the past, the main concern was "Fidelity" (how statistically similar it is to real data). Now, "Utility" (how much it actually aids model training) and "Privacy" (how safe it is from personal information infringement) must be considered simultaneously.

Specifically, Fairness metrics have been integrated as core evaluation factors to ensure the ethical values of AI. International standards such as ISO/IEC 5259 provide guidelines for quantitatively verifying the quality of synthetic data. Korea is leading the establishment of these AI safety and reliability data quality standards, raising its voice on the international stage. However, as of January 2026, detailed sub-standards such as Parts 5 and 6 of the ISO/IEC 5259 series are still in the drafting stage, and additional time is required to confirm finalized technical figures.

Analysis shows that securing high-quality data is not a simple matter of "refinement." It is an economic choice to maximize reasoning performance and reduce operational costs, as well as an essential strategy for fulfilling social responsibility. However, specific quantitative figures on how the introduction of data governance improves model performance vary by industry. Standardized statistics on performance improvements in the financial sector due to governance adoption are still lacking.

## Practical Application: Roadmap for Building Trustworthy AI

Developers and companies must now map out a data governance roadmap before model optimization.

First, apply standard frameworks such as ISO/IEC 24027 from the data collection stage to monitor bias constantly. Second, instead of relying solely on large-scale models, adopt a strategy to maximize the efficiency of small models by building "textbook-grade" datasets specialized for specific domains. Third, when utilizing synthetic data, perform multi-dimensional evaluations including privacy protection and fairness metrics, moving beyond simple similarity verification.

At this point, practitioners should focus on authoritative verification systems such as TTA’s CAT 2.0 certification. The process of objectively proving model reliability through such systems will be a shortcut to gaining market trust.

### FAQ

**Q: How specifically does data governance improve inference performance?**
**A:** Data governance removes noise throughout the training lifecycle and supplies only high-quality data to the model. This allows the model to grasp context more accurately, leading to reduced unnecessary computations and increased accuracy during inference. Consequently, performance loss can be minimized even during model compression.

**Q: Is it not burdensome for SMEs to adopt expensive data verification frameworks?**
**A:** While initial costs may occur, it is beneficial in the long run considering the costs of retraining models due to low-quality data and risks from bias-related incidents. One can start by gradually applying domestic certification systems like TTA’s CAT 2.0 or open guidelines like NIST AI RMF.

**Q: Can synthetic data completely replace real data?**
**A:** It is more complementary than a complete replacement. Synthetic data demonstrates excellent utility in areas requiring augmentation for rare cases or privacy protection. However, precise utility and fairness evaluations according to the ISO/IEC 5259 standard must be presupposed to prevent side effects in actual training.

## Conclusion

The core of AI reliability lies not in the number of model parameters, but in the quality of the data the model has ingested. Sophisticated data curation and strict governance systems are the only paths to simultaneously securing the technical maturity and ethical value of AI models. Moving forward, technical details of data quality management are expected to become more specific according to the finalization of sub-standards for ISO/IEC 5259 and the direction of TTA CAT 3.0 discussions. Now, only companies that handle data "correctly" rather than "more" will survive the AI competition.
