The combination of AI and neuroscience is redesigning human cognitive structures. This technology presents precise pathways for treating trauma and social anxiety.

## Current Status: Investigated Facts and Data
AI-based Digital Therapeutics (DTx) combine Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) algorithms with Virtual Reality (VR). This technology significantly reduces the Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN) index [[가상현실 치료, 사회불안장애에 효과 - 병원신문](https://www.khanews.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=218698)]. Clinical studies have demonstrated that user self-awareness improved by approximately 35% [[Do AI Chatbot Therapists Improve Mental Health Outcomes Over Time?](https://outrightcrm.com/blog/do-ai-chatbot-therapists-improve-mental-health-outcomes-over-time/)].

Memory reconsolidation blocking technology currently shows conflicting research results. A 2024 meta-analysis reported a lack of significant results for propranolol compared to placebos [[Updated and rectified meta-analysis shows no effect of propranolol versus placebo on traumatic memory reconsolidation disruption](https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/full/10.1139/cjpp-2024-0010)]. However, a 2025 fMRI study confirmed neurological mechanisms, such as changes in hippocampal connectivity [[Hippocampal connectivity changes after traumatic memory reactivation with propranolol for PTSD: a randomized fMRI study](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11034567/)].

## Analysis: Meaning and Impact
LLMs detect cognitive biases and provide corrective feedback in real-time [[Safety and Efficacy of Modular Digital Psychotherapy for Social Anxiety: Randomized Controlled Trial](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11135243/)]. VR exposure therapy helps users overcome social hierarchy anxiety. These interventions contribute to mitigating factors of low self-esteem, such as self-contempt.

BCI ethical guidelines focus on protecting user autonomy and cognitive liberty [[OECD Recommendation on Responsible Innovation in Neurotechnology](https://legalinstruments.oecd.org/en/instruments/OECD-LEGAL-0457)]. The OECD emphasizes that emotional changes should not undermine an individual's identity. The principles of "Neurorights" prevent social pressure from forcing specific emotional states [[Wired Emotions: Ethical Issues of Affective Brain–Computer Interfaces](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6414577/)].

## Practical Application: How Readers Can Utilize This
Patients can monitor their cognitive biases in real-time using AI chatbots. Medical professionals can control patient anxiety responses by simulating social situations in VR environments. Researchers can track hippocampal connectivity via fMRI to design optimal dosages for pharmacological treatments.

## FAQ
**Q: How much do AI-based digital therapeutics improve self-awareness?**
**A:** According to recent clinical results, they improve user self-awareness by approximately 35% [[Do AI Chatbot Therapists Improve Mental Health Outcomes Over Time?](https://outrightcrm.com/blog/do-ai-chatbot-therapists-improve-mental-health-outcomes-over-time/)].

**Q: Is memory editing using propranolol clinically proven?**
**A:** Recent meta-analyses and fMRI studies show conflicting results, and further clinical trials are currently underway [[Updated and rectified meta-analysis shows no effect of propranolol versus placebo on traumatic memory reconsolidation disruption](https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/full/10.1139/cjpp-2024-0010)].

**Q: Are there specific laws regarding emotion regulation via BCI?**
**A:** There is no standalone legislation; currently, it follows the OECD recommendations and Neurorights principles [[OECD Recommendation on Responsible Innovation in Neurotechnology](https://legalinstruments.oecd.org/en/instruments/OECD-LEGAL-0457)].

## Conclusion: Summary + Action Suggestions
AI and BCI technologies treat psychological disorders by increasing the precision of cognitive restructuring. Medical institutions should adopt verified algorithms and strictly adhere to Neurorights ethical guidelines.
