# Hallucinating Language Models: Is It Because They Lack a Body?

The 'hallucination' phenomenon, where large language models (LLMs) confidently generate non-factual content, is not a simple bug. It is known as an inherent limitation stemming from the model's fundamental design of next-token prediction. Recent research connects this phenomenon to a 'cyber ghost' state—an environment devoid of physical feedback—and suggests an intriguing possibility, informed by robotics insights, that embodied AI may hold the key to recursive self-improvement.

## Current Status: Investigated Facts and Data

According to analyses by OpenAI and Anthropic, the core cause of LLM hallucination lies in the fact that models are trained to follow statistical patterns learned from data—the probabilistic flow of sentences—rather than truthfulness. Evaluation systems also incentivize models to guess rather than refuse to answer when uncertain. Hallucinations particularly occur as statistical errors regarding information that appears rarely in the training data.

Meanwhile, robotics and Embodied AI research demonstrates the transformative power of physical feedback. Models that integrate physical feedback, such as tactile or force feedback, can perceive friction or slippage that is undetectable by vision alone. This enables real-time error correction and online adaptation, allowing them to achieve significantly higher success rates and learning efficiency in complex object manipulation tasks compared to vision-only models.

## Analysis: Meaning and Impact

These facts provide clues to test an important hypothesis. The hallucination of current LLMs may not be merely a flaw in the algorithm but a side effect of the 'cyber ghost' state, where the rich feedback loop of physical interaction with the world is blocked. Models circulate only within the abstracted world of text and cannot directly verify what consequences their outputs have in physical reality.

This connects to the concept of Recursive Self-Improvement (RSI). RSI is defined as the process where an AI modifies its own algorithms and architecture to repeatedly amplify its intelligence. One of the key prerequisites for this process is the 'validation of improvements.' The physical world can serve as the ultimate validation device, providing clear and immediate feedback. Embodied agents directly experience the consequences of their actions, possessing the potential to build a recursive cycle that improves the model to be more accurate and practical based on this feedback.

## Practical Application: Methods Readers Can Utilize

Developers and researchers should recognize the limitations of LLMs and establish systems that utilize independent verification tools or knowledge graphs before trusting a model's output in applications requiring critical fact-checking. Furthermore, when integrating generative AI into real-world tasks, consider designing as closed a feedback loop as possible. For example, for a code-generating AI, one could explore methods to feed back the results of compiling and test-running the generated code as additional training data for the model.

## FAQ

**Q: Can the hallucination phenomenon in LLMs be completely eliminated?**
A: With the current next-token prediction-based architecture, it is difficult to fundamentally eliminate hallucination. Research from OpenAI and Anthropic points to this as an inherent limitation of the models, focusing on mitigation strategies.

**Q: Is physical embodiment essential for all AI models?**
A: It is not essential for all AI tasks. However, in fields where interaction with the physical world is core, such as manipulation, exploration, and field service robotics, physical feedback has been confirmed as an essential element that dramatically improves model robustness and precision.

**Q: How long will it take for Recursive Self-Improvement (RSI) to be realized?**
A: The technical prerequisites for realizing RSI (e.g., access to system source code, formal verification capability) are not yet fully in place. In particular, there is no consensus within academia on the specific threshold that would lead to an uncontrollable intelligence explosion.

## Conclusion

LLM hallucination may be a symptom revealing the limitations of a learning method isolated from the world, beyond being just an algorithmic flaw. In contrast, feedback through physical embodiment is a powerful tool that allows models to learn the causal relationships of reality beyond abstraction. When discussing the evolution of true intelligence, it is time to focus on the recursive learning cycle of agents that have not just a mind, but also a body. The next step lies in finding ways to invite the ghosts of text to become actors in reality.
