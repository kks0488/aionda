## TL;DR
- Neuralink's Blindsight stimulates the visual cortex, and AlphaFold predicts protein structures for disease treatment.
- These tools shift medical focus from basic treatment to restoring functions and shortening analysis times.
- Decision-makers should integrate protein databases into research and review ethical guidelines for brain-computer interfaces.

Example: A person born without sight wears a headset. Cameras send signals to the brain through small sensors. The person perceives shapes and spaces without using their eyes.

Visual information can now reach the brain directly without passing through the eyes. The combination of brain-computer interfaces (BCI) and artificial intelligence (AI) provides a path to bypass biological limitations. Neuralink’s Blindsight and Google DeepMind’s AlphaFold represent attempts to transform human survival from hardware and software perspectives.

## Current Status: AI Analyzing the Brain and Proteins
Technology is being developed to transmit visual information directly by implanting microelectrodes into the brain’s visual cortex. Neuralink’s Blindsight allows patients with damaged retinas to perceive visual data if their visual cortex is functional. The technology is in early stages and the restoration resolution is currently low. It is gaining attention as an attempt to replace biological eyes with digital devices.

In the software domain, Google DeepMind’s AlphaFold series is accelerating biotechnological analysis. AlphaMissense analyzes 71 million possible missense variants in the human proteome to classify causes of rare genetic diseases. AlphaFold resolves processes in a short time that previously required years of experiments for a single structure. AlphaGenome also contributes to drug discovery efficiency by predicting variant impacts in genetic diseases.

These technological advances lead to specific disease research. AlphaFold has been used to analyze Alsin, a protein related to rare motor neuron diseases. The AI-generated protein structure database provides researchers with new indicators to identify disease causes.

## Analysis: From 'Treatment' to 'Restoration' and 'Design'
The emergence of BCI technology and AI models like AlphaFold signify a shift in medical technology objectives. Traditional medical technology focused on maintaining organ function through medication or surgery. The focus is now on bypassing damaged organs or solving problems through protein structure identification. This impacts the medical industry and the definition of human physical capabilities.

However, technical challenges remain. Verification is needed to determine how closely the vision provided by Blindsight resembles natural sight. The long-term stability of implanted electrodes and potential rejection responses are still issues. Rigorous approval procedures and biological validation are necessary for actual clinical success. As of 2026-02-01, cases where AI data led to drug approval require further confirmation.

## Practical Application
Researchers and companies in biotechnology and medical AI need strategies to apply open-source databases to research sites.

**Checklist for Today:**
- Search for protein data in the AlphaFold database and reflect findings in analysis reports.
- Monitor clinical trial registration for brain-computer interfaces to explore signal conversion algorithm opportunities.
- Utilize variant data from AlphaMissense to build pathogenicity prediction scenarios for genetic variants.

## FAQ
**Q: Is the vision restored by Blindsight at the same level as normal sight?**
A: No, early technology likely transmits abstract information in the form of dots or lines. Implementing high-resolution vision requires more electrode implants and sophisticated signal processing.

**Q: Does using AlphaFold data reduce drug development costs?**
A: It contributes to saving initial costs and time during target identification and structure determination. Subsequent high-cost processes like toxicity testing and clinical trials are still required.

**Q: Is BCI technology, which involves planting chips in the brain, safe?**
A: Implantation involves surgical procedures with risks such as infection or brain tissue damage. Companies use robotic surgery to lower risks, and long-term safety observations continue.

## Conclusion
Neuralink’s Blindsight and Google’s AlphaFold reinterpret the human body from the perspectives of data and structure. Brain-computer interfaces are restoring sensory loss, and AI is decoding proteins to fight rare diseases. We should monitor ethical and technical issues as these technologies enter the medical system. Humanity is rewriting the definition of the body by supplementing biological limitations with technology.
