# Forcing Code Execution: The Community's Secret Weapon for Boosting LLM Math Skills

Research shows that when large language models (LLMs) solve math problems, forcing them to directly execute code can improve accuracy by 12-15% or more compared to simply reasoning in text. Recently, experiments in the community have gained attention for forcibly enabling the code execution feature by changing the default settings of models like Gemini or ChatGPT, thereby boosting performance, especially in solving complex math problems like calculus. This goes beyond simple feature utilization and stands as a practical example of prompt engineering where users reconfigure the model's reasoning approach.

## Current Status: Investigated Facts and Data

The LLM code execution feature works by running Python code generated by the model in an isolated sandbox environment to derive results. According to official documentation, this environment blocks external network access, and execution time is limited to approximately 30 to 120 seconds depending on the platform. Predefined math and science calculation libraries (e.g., Numpy, Pandas) are available, providing favorable conditions for accurately performing complex calculations.

The utility of this code execution approach has been proven through benchmark studies. Research such as PAL (Program-aided Language Models) or PoT (Program-of-Thoughts), when validated using datasets like GSM8K and MATH, show that models using code execution in parallel achieve significantly higher accuracy than the traditional Chain-of-Thought approach. This is because deterministic code execution is more effective at reducing calculation errors compared to reasoning that relies on stochastic text generation.

## Analysis: Meaning and Impact

The setting to force code execution is officially described as a tool to increase the reliability of model outputs. By making the model solve problems through structured logic like code, rather than predicting words, the transparency and reproducibility of the reasoning process increase. In terms of safety, the sandbox isolation environment acts as a fundamental mechanism to block risks of system intrusion or data leakage due to code execution.

However, this approach also has clear limitations. As pointed out in community experiments, in cases requiring high-level creative problem-solving like the Korean SAT Calculus problem number 30, the code execution feature alone may reach its limits. Furthermore, forcing code execution for all responses can lead to performance degradation in areas like creative writing or simple conversation, and the possibility of logical errors or security vulnerabilities in the generated code itself remains a challenge.

## Practical Application: Methods Readers Can Use

To maximize the benefits of code execution, strategic prompt engineering is necessary. Users can guide the model's behavior with explicit instructions like "Write and execute Python code to solve this problem." This functions like a kind of 'default-setting add-on,' making the model prioritize code generation instead of remaining in text-based reasoning.

When applying it practically, attention must be paid to session management. The community's empirical tip that performance may degrade in long, ongoing conversation sessions suggests that starting a new chat session might be more effective when solving complex math problems. This allows the model to focus on code execution tasks in an optimal, undisturbed context.

## FAQ

**Q: Is forcing code execution the best method for all math problems?**
A: No. Code execution is particularly useful for problems with complex calculations or those requiring step-by-step verification. However, for problem types like conceptual explanations or describing proof processes, where pure textual reasoning is more suitable, it can actually be inefficient.

**Q: Can we guarantee that code execution results are always accurate?**
A: It cannot be guaranteed. While code execution increases the accuracy of the calculation process, if the model misunderstands the problem or generates code with logical errors, it will produce incorrect results. Execution results also require user verification.

**Q: Is there a risk of my data being leaked during code execution?**
A: Officially, the sandbox environment is designed to block external network access. Therefore, the risk of calculation results or input data from within the code execution being leaked externally is considered low. However, caution is always needed when inputting sensitive information.

## Conclusion

Forcibly activating the code execution feature is a practical strategy that can upgrade the performance of LLMs when using them as math problem-solving tools. Research results and community experiments show that this method can improve calculation accuracy by a measurable degree, but it's important to recognize that it is not a universal solution for all problems. Users can maximize the benefits of this powerful feature by judging the problem type, guiding the model with explicit prompts, and working in a new session when necessary.
