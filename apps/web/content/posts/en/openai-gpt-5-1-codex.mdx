What if coding AI went beyond just writing code and managed projects on its own? (Problem)
In November 2025, OpenAI opened the era of **Agentic Coding** with the launch of **GPT 5.2.1 Codex** and **Codex Max** models. (Solution)
These models are specialized not for one-off code generation, but for long-breath project management, complex debugging, and autonomous tool usage. (Evidence)

## Features of GPT 5.2.1 Codex

### 1. Agentic Optimization
While existing models passively waited for user instructions, Codex models set plans and execute them on their own when given a Goal.

### 2. Codex CLI Integration
Combined with the `Codex CLI` that operates directly in the terminal environment, it performs everything from file creation to test execution and git commits without the developer's help.

### 3. Steerability
The ability to more accurately grasp the developer's intent, reduce unnecessary explanations, and output only the core code concisely has been strengthened.

## Usage Scenarios
- **Legacy Code Migration**: You can have it analyze thousands of lines of code and convert them to a modern stack overnight.
- **Automated Test Writing**: When a feature is implemented, it automatically finds edge cases, writes test code, and fixes it until it passes.
