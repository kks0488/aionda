Praise for Large Language Models (LLMs) has surpassed a critical threshold. Current market valuations significantly outpace the technical reality.

The term "Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)" is mere marketing rhetoric. Current achievements are the result of sophisticated probabilistic prediction. They align more closely with statistical pattern matching than the true essence of intelligence.

## The Reality of Benchmark Contamination

Current benchmark scores are difficult to trust. Instances where test data is included in the training set are frequent. High scores serve as evidence of memorization rather than intelligence.

Data contamination distorts the objective performance of models. While they may excel at solving established problems, they often prove powerless when confronted with novel challenges.

## Absence of Reasoning and Statistical Approximation

LLMs do not comprehend logic; they predict the next word. In multi-step logical structures, errors are inevitable. Complex reasoning processes are merely sequences of "plausible" words.

Hallucination is a fundamental characteristic of these systems. There is no internal mechanism to verify factual consistency. Overestimating unreliable tools incurs significant technical debt.

## Limits of Practical Productivity

Code generation capabilities remain at the level of assistive tools. The ability to understand entire architectures is still lacking. It is difficult to attribute value beyond the automation of simple, repetitive tasks.

The quality of output relative to the input cost is questionable. While consuming vast computing resources, only incremental improvements are being achieved. Exponential growth has stalled, and the technology has entered a phase of convergence.

## Counterarguments

Productivity gains in specific fields are undeniably real. They are efficient for tasks such as code summarization or writing simple boilerplate. Their utility as a tool cannot be dismissed entirely.

## Conclusion: A Time for Objective Assessment

We must strip away the technical bubble and confront practical limitations. Instead of exaggerated promotion, the focus should shift toward concrete use cases. What is urgently needed is not a cynical perspective, but an objective engineering mindset.
