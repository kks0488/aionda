The era has arrived where the limits of computing power are determined not by algorithms, but by 'power.' Sam Altman’s OpenAI is seeking to transform from a software company developing models into an infrastructure giant directly managing massive energy resources. In collaboration with SoftBank Group and its subsidiary SB Energy, OpenAI has begun constructing a large-scale AI campus in Texas, including a 1.2-gigawatt (GW) data center, effectively igniting the engine of the 'Stargate' project.

### A 1.2 GW Ambition on the Texas Plains

The core of this collaboration lies in the numbers. 1.2 GW is a figure comparable to the generation capacity of a medium-sized nuclear power plant. This immense power is sufficient to simultaneously run approximately 400,000 of NVIDIA's next-generation Blackwell (GB200) GPUs. By jointly investing $1 billion in SB Energy, OpenAI and SoftBank have signaled their intent to secure power infrastructure and directly tackle energy supply issues—the primary bottleneck in training next-generation AI.

The campus, to be established across three Texas regions—Milam, Shackelford, and Abilene—will account for approximately 24% of the total 5 GW power target for OpenAI's 'Stargate' project. This strategy goes beyond merely renting servers; it aims to secure supply chain independence and reduce reliance on cloud providers through vertical integration, spanning from energy production to operations.

Stargate's footprint is already expanding beyond Texas across the United States. Lordstown, Ohio; Doña Ana County, New Mexico; and Port Washington, Wisconsin have been confirmed or are strongly mentioned as candidates for next-generation multi-gigawatt data centers. Furthermore, OpenAI’s blueprint includes expanding this massive computational network globally to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the United Kingdom, Norway, and Japan.

### The Era Where Power is Intelligence: Why SoftBank?

The reason OpenAI chose SoftBank as a partner is clear. SoftBank, through SB Energy, already possesses large-scale land and grid connection rights. Considering that 'grid permitting' is the most time-consuming task in data center construction, the alliance with SoftBank is a shortcut that dramatically accelerates the pace of the Stargate project.

This move signifies a paradigm shift in the AI industry. While writing superior code was central in the past, securing a stable and massive power supply has now become the ticket to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). A 1.2 GW infrastructure provides an environment for training models with parameters expanded tens of times compared to existing ones in shorter cycles or for training multiple large models in parallel. This is expected to serve as the practical foundation for developing computationally intensive AGI models.

However, it is not all rosy. Concerns regarding the stability of the Texas power grid (ERCOT) remain, and the impact of the massive energy consumption by a single facility on local community power supplies cannot be ignored. Furthermore, securing astronomical funding—estimated at approximately $500 billion (approx. 660 trillion KRW)—and ensuring profitability for the Stargate project remain significant challenges for OpenAI.

### What Developers and Businesses Should Prepare

The expansion of OpenAI's infrastructure will ultimately lead to a 'decrease in inference costs' and an 'explosive improvement in model performance.' Developers must now prepare for multimodal agent environments that perform high-resolution video and real-time physical simulations simultaneously, moving beyond simple text processing.

1.  **Agentic AI Design**: As computational resources become more abundant, the cost of running AI agents that perform complex reasoning steps will decrease. Focus should shift from simple chatbots to designing workflows where AI can judge and execute autonomously.
2.  **Quenching the Data Thirst**: Even with infrastructure ready, it is useless without 'high-quality data' to learn from. Synthetic data generation technology and the acquisition of proprietary data in vertical domains will become even more critical.
3.  **Diversifying Infrastructure Dependency**: Just as OpenAI is building independent infrastructure, companies need to advance multi-model strategies to avoid being locked into specific models or cloud providers.

### FAQ

**Q: Why Texas?**
A: Texas operates its own independent power grid within the U.S. and has vast land, making it advantageous for large-scale data center construction. Specifically, SoftBank’s SB Energy holds strong solar and Energy Storage System (ESS) assets in Texas, enabling a more stable power supply.

**Q: What is the ultimate goal of the Stargate project?**
A: The goal is to realize AGI with human-level intelligence by combining approximately 5 GW of power and millions of GPUs. To achieve this, the aim is to attract a total investment of $500 billion and build massive computational hubs worldwide.

**Q: Does this collaboration change the existing relationship with Microsoft (MS)?**
A: OpenAI still maintains a close partnership with MS, but partnering with SoftBank and Oracle is a strategic move to diversify its infrastructure providers. It reflects an intent to control computational resources that were previously dependent solely on MS.

### Energy Hegemony Will Define the Future of AI

The Texas collaboration between OpenAI and SoftBank symbolically demonstrates that the AI competition has shifted from software to hardware, and now to energy infrastructure. 1.2 GW of massive power is not just energy to run servers; it is like 'digital crude oil' for the birth of a level of artificial intelligence that humanity has never experienced before. The industry's gaze is now fixed on what form of intelligence will materialize from the immense computational power emerging from the rugged fields of Texas. Stargate has opened, and the landscape beyond depends on the firepower of the power grid.
