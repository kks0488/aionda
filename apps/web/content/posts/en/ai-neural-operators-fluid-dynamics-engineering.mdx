The nonlinear maze of the Navier-Stokes equations, which has challenged humanity for centuries, has met a new key in Artificial Intelligence. Beyond the stage of simply learning data, attempts to internalize physical laws themselves within neural networks are fundamentally reshaping engineering design and basic science. An era has opened where AI models process complex fluid flow calculations in seconds—tasks that previously required supercomputers in laboratories to labor for days.

## Conquering Symbolic Mathematics, but the Wall of Physics Remains High

As of early 2026, Google's Gemini 3 Pro and OpenAI's GPT-5.1 are demonstrating phenomenal achievements in the realm of symbolic mathematics. In the AIME 2025 benchmark, a mathematical competition, Gemini 3 Pro recorded a perfect score of 100% when utilizing tools, and GPT-5.1 also proved its structured mathematical reasoning capabilities with an accuracy rate of over 94%. This suggests that AI's ability to manipulate complex formulas and find answers within established rules has reached a level of maturity.

However, the story changes when moving into the domain of understanding actual physical phenomena. In 'CritPt,' a high-difficulty benchmark for physics research, Gemini 3 Pro and GPT-5.1 received humble scores of 9.1% and 4.9%, respectively. Current generation Large Language Models (LLMs) still reveal limitations in intuitively reasoning through the nonlinearity and multiscale turbulence phenomena that are core to fluid dynamics. This means that while their ability as 'calculators' to solve math problems is excellent, their insight as 'scholars' to grasp physical reality still has a long way to go.

To bridge this gap, Google DeepMind is focusing on developing specialized models for fluid dynamics, separate from general-purpose models. They have drawn significant attention from the engineering community by proposing new numerical solutions to long-standing challenges in fluid dynamics that remained unsolved throughout the last century.

## From Points to Space: The Emergence of Neural Operators

The mainstream of existing AI fluid dynamics has been Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). PINNs adopt a 'point-wise' approach, reducing errors in physical equations at individual points within a specific space. However, this method had a critical weakness: the model had to be retrained whenever new boundary conditions or physical parameters were introduced.

Recent technical breakthroughs have stemmed from Neural Operator architectures. In particular, the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) processes data in the spectral domain to directly learn the mapping between function spaces. This approach supports resolution-independent predictions and allows for immediate inference (Zero-shot generalization) under new conditions once trained, without the need for retraining.

Models such as DeepONet, which introduce graph structures or Branch-Trunk architectures, precisely capture complex aircraft wing geometries or fine turbulence flows inside engines. This is a decisive differentiator that breaks through the computational cost barriers inherent in traditional numerical analysis techniques.

## Field Deployment: From Weather Forecasting to Aerospace Design

These technological advances are already changing the landscape of industrial sites. The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) officially began operating its AI Forecasting System (AIFS) in July 2025. This system predicts global weather patterns at speeds hundreds of times faster than traditional numerical weather prediction models. It is achieving results that maintain or even improve forecast accuracy while significantly reducing supercomputer resource consumption.

Ihe aerospace field is also buzzing. At CES 2026, 'AOX,' an AI-based aerodynamic platform, was unveiled, featuring the ability to simulate aerodynamic characteristics in real-time during the early stages of aircraft design. This technology, which combines Reduced Order Models (ROM) and PINNs, has dramatically shortened the time required for design optimization.

However, the 'Certification' stage for actual aircraft to fly remains conservative. This is because it is difficult to prove that the results produced by AI are physically perfect. Currently, the aviation industry adopts a strategy of using AI as an initial design guide while performing final verification through traditional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and wind tunnel experiments.

## A Guide for Practitioners: How to Respond to the Era of AI Fluid Dynamics

Engineers and researchers should now focus more on 'how to physically guide the AI model' rather than 'how to run the solver.'

1. **Establish Hybrid Workflows**: Rather than entrusting the entire process to AI, adopt a hybrid approach where data generation is performed with traditional CFD, and the learned model is used to rapidly explore the design space.
2. **Utilize Reduced Order Models (ROM)**: It is advantageous to learn reduced-order modeling techniques that simplify complex physical phenomena into core features for training.
3. **Design Physical Constraints**: The ability to sophisticatedly integrate physical equations into Loss Functions to ensure AI does not violate physical laws will be a core competitive advantage.

## FAQ

**Q1: Can AI models completely replace traditional numerical analysis software?**
A1: Currently, it is more of a complementary relationship than a replacement. AI provides overwhelming speed in design optimization and real-time prediction, but traditional numerical analysis techniques still serve as the standard for final certification where rigorous physical proof is required.

**Q2: Is fluid dynamics research possible using only general LLMs like Gemini 3 or GPT-5?**
A2: It is not possible. According to research results, general LLMs are proficient at solving symbolic mathematics but show low accuracy of less than 10% in complex physical reasoning (such as the CritPt benchmark). Specialized models with dedicated neural operators or physics-informed neural network structures are essential.

**Q3: Is AI effective for predicting sub-km scale hyper-local weather phenomena?**
A3: While systems like ECMWF's AIFS are producing results, limitations in data and model precision still exist for sub-kilometer micro-scale turbulence or local weather phenomena affected by terrain. This is an area where active research is currently underway.

## Conclusion

AI-based fluid dynamics has moved beyond a mere research topic to become an industrial reality. While the mathematical reasoning capabilities shown by Gemini 3 and GPT-5.1 suggest that AI is ready to understand the language of physical laws, integration with specialized architectures like neural operators is essential to solve actual physical challenges.

We are now moving from an era of coding physical laws to an era of training them. The future key lies in how AI will overcome the 9.1% barrier seen in the CritPt benchmark and whether it can find solutions to new physical phenomena that humans have yet to discover.
