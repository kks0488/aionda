CES 2026 was the year of robots. Humanoid robots walked, danced, played ping-pong, and folded laundry throughout the Las Vegas Convention Center. Every tech category has its moment, and for robots, that moment arrived at CES 2026.

TechCrunch called it "Physical AI's takeover." For years, AI remained confined to chatbots and image generation—exchanging text on screens or creating pictures. But at CES 2026, AI finally left the screen. It evolved into physical entities that move parts in factories and capture drones from the sky.

## "The Era of AI Only Answering Questions Is Over"

The message from CES 2026 exhibitors was clear: "AI no longer just answers questions. It can now move parts in factories and capture drones."

This wasn't mere tech demonstration. Products ready for actual industrial deployment appeared in force. Hyundai Motor Group announced plans to produce 30,000 humanoid robots annually by 2028, and Nvidia unveiled a complete software stack for robot development.

The diversity of humanoid robots at the venue was striking. Boxing robots, card-playing robots, ping-pong-playing robots, dancing robots, laundry-folding robots, and robots in elaborate costumes. TechRadar observed, "CES 2026 robots were wild, silly, and sometimes disappointing, but there was one that restored faith in robotics."

## The Stars: Who Showed What

### Boston Dynamics Atlas: CES 2026's Standout

Winning the CES 2026 Best Robot award, Atlas was the event's undisputed star. The newly redesigned all-electric humanoid robot is scheduled for deployment at Hyundai factories starting 2028.

Atlas key specs:
- 56 degrees of freedom for flexible movement
- Up to 110-pound (50kg) lift capacity
- Operating range from -4°F to 104°F
- Fully waterproof with automatic battery replacement
- Google DeepMind AI integration

Boston Dynamics didn't just showcase a robot—it declared the start of commercial production. All 2026 deployments are already fully committed.

### Tesla Optimus: Brief Appearance

Tesla Optimus made only a brief appearance with Elon Musk, leaving some disappointment. Musk had promised thousands of Optimus robots deployed at Tesla factories by late 2025, but this didn't materialize.

Gen 3 is expected to debut in early 2026 with improved actuators and more natural movement. The target price is $20,000-$30,000 per unit—dramatically cheaper than competitors. However, external sales have been pushed to 2026 and beyond.

### Figure AI Figure 03: Industrial Optimization

Figure AI presented Figure 03, optimized for industrial tasks and complex manipulation. Its design anticipates mass production.

Backed by massive funding, Figure AI is preparing for home beta testing and mass production in 2026. Through OpenAI collaboration, it features language understanding capabilities for voice-controlled operation.

### Unitree G1/H2: Price Disruptor

China's Unitree G1/H2 drew attention with agile movements. The price is particularly striking—G1 starts at around $16,000, far cheaper than other humanoid robots.

Unitree has already begun pre-orders, targeting 2026 deliveries.

## Nvidia's Declaration: "We Will Become the Android of Robotics"

At CES 2026, Nvidia revealed its ambition to dominate the entire robotics ecosystem. By unveiling a "full-stack ecosystem for robots," it declared intentions to capture the position in robotics that Android holds in smartphones.

Nvidia unveiled:

**Foundation Models**
- Cosmos Transfer 2.5, Cosmos Predict 2.5: World models for synthetic data generation
- Cosmos Reason 2: Reasoning vision language model for physical AI
- Isaac GR00T N1.6: VLA (vision-language-action) model purpose-built for humanoid robots

**Infrastructure Tools**
- Isaac Lab-Arena: Simulation framework for safely testing robot functions
- OSMO: Workflow integration command center

**Hardware**
- Jetson T4000: 1,200 teraflops processing at 40-70 watts

Nvidia's strategy is to become "the default platform for robot development." When robot manufacturers adopt Nvidia's software stack, development time and costs drop significantly. Boston Dynamics, Caterpillar, and Franka Robotics already use Nvidia technology.

## What Physical AI Means

CES 2026's Physical AI trend signals fundamental changes in the AI industry.

**First, expanding AI's boundaries.** Traditional AI represented by ChatGPT was "knowledge AI"—excellent at processing information and generating text but unable to interact with the physical world. Physical AI transcends this limitation. AI can now pick up objects, assemble them, and move them.

**Second, the shift to pragmatism.** TechCrunch analyzed that "if 2025 was AI's vibe check year, 2026 is the year AI gets practical." The focus moves from competing to build bigger, more expensive language models toward making AI genuinely useful.

**Third, labor market transformation.** Multiple venture capitalists surveyed by TechCrunch said "AI will significantly impact the enterprise workforce in 2026." Robots are expected to supplement or replace human labor particularly in manufacturing, logistics, and warehouse operations.

## FAQ

### Q1. When will humanoid robots be available in regular homes?

Consumer humanoid robots are expected to commercialize after 2030. Current focus is on industrial applications (factories, logistics warehouses), and price and safety issues must be resolved before home deployment. Figure AI plans home beta testing in 2026, but this is a limited pilot program. Full consumer deployment will be possible once robot prices drop below $5,000 and safety regulations are established.

### Q2. What roles are Korean companies playing?

Hyundai Motor Group is most active, owning Boston Dynamics and planning to be the first to deploy Atlas robots at its factories. Samsung Electronics focuses on AI semiconductors and Galaxy AI rather than robots. LG Electronics develops the CLOi home service robot. Naver and Kakao invest in autonomous driving and logistics robots.

### Q3. Will Physical AI replace jobs?

In the short term, it's closer to "supplementation." Manufacturing already suffers from chronic labor shortages, so robots fill unfilled positions. Long-term, some job displacement is inevitable—particularly repetitive physical labor (assembly, packaging, moving) will be affected first. However, new jobs in robot management, maintenance, and programming are also expected to emerge.
