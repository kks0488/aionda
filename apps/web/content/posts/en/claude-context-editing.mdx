The 'context window exceeded' error has been a chronic problem in long conversations or complex agent tasks using LLMs. (Problem)
Anthropic elegantly solved this problem with **Context Editing** and **Thinking Block Clearing** features. (Solution)
This is a technology that allows AI to 'forget' completed thinking processes or old tool usage records in the middle of a conversation, just like humans organize unnecessary short-term memories while sleeping. (Evidence)

## Core Feature: Thinking Block Clearing

### What is it?
The vast amount of 'Thinking Blocks' generated by Claude models (especially Opus/Sonnet 4.5) when solving complex problems are one-time consumables. If this thought process remains in the context even after the problem is solved, it occupies unnecessary tokens.
Turning on the `clear_thinking_20251015` option makes the AI automatically delete the intermediate thought process from the context after reaching a conclusion.

## Context Editing Strategies

1. **Delete Old Tool Results**: If dozens of web search results are piled up, keep only the most recent results and summarize or delete previous data.
2. **Client-side Compaction**: At the SDK level, if the conversation gets long, it is automatically replaced with a summary before transmission.

## Benefits
- **Cost Reduction**: Input token count decreases, reducing API costs.
- **Performance Maintenance**: Since the context is kept clean, the AI remembers initial instructions well and reacts smartly even in the later parts of the conversation.
