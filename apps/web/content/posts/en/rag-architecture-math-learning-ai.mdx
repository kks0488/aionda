## TL;DR
- AI math learning is moving toward retrieval-augmented architectures and isolated data storage.
- This approach reduces model dependency and helps control logical errors in reasoning.
- Developers should use external databases and structured prompts to improve response consistency.

Example: A student pauses during a geometry problem. The software checks previous mistakes in the database. It then suggests specific steps focusing on common errors.

## Current Status

## Analysis

## Practical Application
Technical designs should prioritize model independence. Developers can keep data in external databases for better interchangeability. Structural tags can be used in prompt design. Tags like context and task help define model roles. Prompts should guide the system through step-by-step reasoning. Asking for a plan before the solution can be effective.

**Checklist for Today:**
- Define the vector database format by categorizing problem data today.
- Design a NoSQL schema to store user history for personalized feedback.
- Test how adding examples to prompts affects the accuracy of responses.

## FAQ
**Q: Is building a retrieval system better than fine-tuning?**
A: Retrieval systems often offer more flexibility for mathematics. They allow real-time updates to problems and solutions.

**Q: Do models struggle with mathematical symbols?**
A: Text-based models may misread complex formula structures. Converting formulas to LaTeX format can improve consistency.

**Q: How are history and vector data linked?**
A: Systems can store error types in NoSQL databases. The AI then retrieves similar problems from the vector database.

## Conclusion
Mathematics learning solutions rely on robust data architecture. Isolated data storage helps turn general models into specialized tools. Success depends on the architecture handling verified data. The model performance alone is not the only factor. Future success may depend on identifying specific conceptual gaps. Prompt strategies that encourage learners to correct errors themselves can determine competitiveness.
