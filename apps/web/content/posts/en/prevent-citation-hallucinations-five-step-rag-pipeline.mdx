## TL;DR

- RAG can fail across five stages, which can lead to wrong answers with unsupported citations.  
- Papers like arXiv:2601.05866 and arXiv:2510.10390 frame citation hallucination and refusal as key risks.  
- Validate chunking, retrieval, and refusal behavior with targeted tests before relying on citations.

A chatbot answers a refund-policy question with a confident quote that is not in the document.  
That mismatch can reduce trust in RAG outputs.

Example: During a team meeting, someone asks for a policy summary. The reply sounds precise. A colleague checks the document. The cited sentence is missing.

This article breaks RAG into ingestion/indexing → chunking → embedding → retrieval → generation.  
It summarizes failure patterns that can reduce accuracy at each stage.  
It also suggests ways to reduce these failures.

The point is narrow.  
RAG quality can fail due to document structure, chunking, queries, ranking, and evidence control.  
Model choice can matter, but it is not the only factor.

## Current state

As RAG adoption grows, plausible answers with conflicting evidence can become an operational risk.  
The OpenAI Help Center describes chunking and embedding during file-based retrieval.  
This supports treating RAG as a five-stage pipeline.

A longer pipeline can add more failure points.  
Surveyed findings group failures into four branches.

(1) Indexing and ingestion can lose structure or operational metadata.  
Examples include permissions or version fields.  
That loss can destabilize later stages.

(2) Chunking can be too small, too large, or structure-blind.  
That can break context.  
It can reduce embedding and retrieval quality.

(3) Retrieval can fail due to ambiguous queries or weak ranking.  
Reranking and filtering design can also be weak.  
Relevant documents may not surface.

(4) Generation can fail when retrieved context is insufficient.  
The model can hallucinate.  
Unsupported citations and sources are a common symptom.

Academic work addresses these failures more concretely.  
FACTUM (arXiv:2601.05866) discusses citation hallucination in long-form RAG.  
It defines a case where a cited source does not support the claim.  
RefusalBench (arXiv:2510.10390) evaluates selective refusal under insufficient context.  
It argues this behavior is tied to safety.

## Analysis

Accuracy is not a single metric in RAG.  
At least three properties should hold together.

(1) Retrieval relevance should be correct.  
(2) Generation should stay grounded in retrieved evidence.  
(3) The system should refuse when evidence is insufficient.

Chunking errors can weaken retrieval.  
Weak retrieval can pressure generation to fill gaps.  
That chain can produce citation hallucination.  
A model swap alone may not change this chain.

Operational risk also deserves separate attention.  
Surveyed findings cite ingestion failures around structure and metadata.  
Examples include permissions and version information.  
Quality and safety can diverge here.

An obsolete document can still yield a plausible answer.  
That can be risky for audits, compliance, or internal policy work.  
In those settings, the version used can matter.

It is hard to generalize ACL metadata failures across the industry from this text.  
The source also labels it as Unverified.  
More confirmation would help.

Limitations remain.  
RAG does not help ensure correct answers whenever a document exists.  
The document can be wrong.  
Chunking can tear necessary context.  
Correct retrieval can still produce exaggerated citations.

FACTUM’s citation hallucination can be costly.  
A citation can make an answer look correct.  
That can increase detection and response costs.

RefusalBench raises a practical question.  
When evidence is insufficient, does the system stop?  
In production, this becomes both a quality and safety issue.

## Practical application

Teams can treat the pipeline as a product, not only a feature.  
In ingestion, preserve structure and provenance cues where possible.  
In chunking, avoid relying only on physical breaks like paragraphs.  
Design around logical blocks like title, body, tables, and footnotes.

In retrieval, verify more than “it retrieved something.”  
Check whether the intended document appears near the top.  
In generation, prioritize evidence control over style.  
Cite only when the citation exists in the document.  
Refuse when evidence is insufficient.

**Checklist for Today:**  
- Review chunking outputs and check that headings and exception clauses stay with their relevant text.  
- Inspect retrieval filtering and reranking so likely-relevant documents appear near the top for ambiguous queries.  
- Run refusal test cases and verify the system avoids citing unsupported passages when evidence is thin.

## FAQ

**Q1. What should I fix first in RAG?**  
A. Surveyed findings often point to chunking as an early lever.  
Chunks that ignore structure can weaken embedding and retrieval.  
Start by locating splits that break necessary context.

**Q2. Why is citation hallucination more dangerous?**  
A. FACTUM describes citations that do not support the claim.  
Such answers can look credible because they include sources.  
That can make human review less reliable.

**Q3. Why is “say you don’t know” important in RAG?**  
A. RefusalBench links selective refusal to safer behavior.  
If context is insufficient, forcing an answer can break grounding.  
The system then behaves like plausible writing.

## Conclusion

RAG is closer to a production line than search plus a model.  
Chunking, retrieval design, and evidence control interact.  
Small choices across chunking → retrieval → generation can cause citation hallucination.  
They can also cause selective refusal failures.

A practical next step is to treat refusal as a product requirement.  
Validate it with tests that reflect insufficient evidence.  
Then iterate on chunking and retrieval to reduce avoidable gaps.
