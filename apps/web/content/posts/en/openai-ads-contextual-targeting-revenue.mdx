For users who hesitated at the subscription payment window, OpenAI has presented a new option. This model grants access to high-performance AI in exchange for allowing advertisements between conversations with the chatbot. OpenAI has begun testing an advertising system targeting free users and 'ChatGPT Go' tier users in the United States, moving to diversify its revenue structure for the global democratization of AI. This signifies that the central axis of the generative AI industry is shifting from a simple subscription economy to an ad-based hybrid model.

### Penetrating 'Conversation' Beyond 'Search'

OpenAI's latest experiment is a project to bring the AI revenue model, previously confined within the text box, out into the open. The core focus is exposing advertisements to free users and those on the low-cost 'ChatGPT Go' plan (approximately 15,000 KRW per month) in the U.S. market. To minimize disruption to information exploration, OpenAI has designed the system to place ads at the bottom of responses and label them clearly to prevent confusion with generated content.

Of particular note is the targeting method. Instead of building permanent user profiles, OpenAI has introduced 'Contextual Targeting,' which analyzes the topic and intent of the ongoing conversation in real-time. For example, if a user asks about travel plans, ads for flight booking sites or accommodation platforms may appear at the bottom of the response. Furthermore, the company has established a policy to exclude sensitive topics such as health or politics from advertising to maintain service credibility.

While traditional search ads were keyword-centered, ChatGPT's ads target the user's specific pain points. The industry expects these conversational ads to record higher click-through rates (CTR) and shorten purchase conversion paths compared to traditional search ads. However, quantitative impacts on actual user retention and specific preference data compared to search advertising remain in the verification stage.

### New Front in Silicon Valley: Light and Shadow of AI Monetization

Behind OpenAI's bold move to introduce advertising lies astronomical AI operating costs. There are clear limits to covering the infrastructure costs required to maintain and advance Large Language Models (LLMs) through subscription fees alone. The introduction of this advertising model signifies a direct, full-scale confrontation with Big Tech companies like Google and Meta, which have already built powerful advertising ecosystems.

However, technical and ethical challenges remain. The primary concern is data privacy. OpenAI emphasizes that it adheres to a 'technical separation principle'—not sharing conversation content with advertisers—and has applied Differential Privacy and data anonymization technologies. The goal is to increase advertising efficiency without identifying individual users. Nevertheless, since specific figures (such as Epsilon values) indicating the degree of information loss when applying Differential Privacy have not been disclosed, questions regarding technical transparency persist.

The competitive landscape of the market is also expected to change rapidly. Large-scale platforms capable of offsetting operating costs with advertising revenue will likely lower entry barriers and strengthen market dominance. In contrast, small and medium-sized AI startups without independent advertising systems are likely to be blocked by the dual barriers of capital and technology. Consequently, the prevailing observation is that the AI market will reorganize around "giant platforms possessing advertising ecosystems."

### Changes Facing Users and Companies

For general users, this change marks the beginning of a transaction: paying with 'time and data' to obtain 'intelligence.' While this opens opportunities for users who found paid subscriptions burdensome to experience high-performance models, they will also carry the cognitive load of constantly questioning whether the ads displayed during conversations compromise the objectivity of the answers.

For companies and marketers, this is a completely new field of opportunity. Unlike traditional static banner ads or top-of-search results, they can naturally propose solutions the moment a user's problem is being solved. Marketers must now move beyond simple keyword preoccupation and consider how to weave brand value into the context of conversations between AI and users.

Developers should note the potential emergence of ad-based API models. If OpenAI begins providing low-cost APIs that include advertisements, it could lead to a revolutionary change in the cost structure for startups developing AI-based services. However, a sophisticated design that adjusts ad placement and frequency is essential, considering that ad exposure can degrade the quality of the User Experience (UX).

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: Is my conversation content delivered directly to advertisers?**

A: No. OpenAI analyzes the context of the conversation in real-time to match ads but adheres to a technical separation principle that does not share original conversation text or personally identifiable information with advertisers. Furthermore, it is strengthening privacy protection through data anonymization technologies.

**Q: Will ads be attached to all conversations?**

A: Currently, testing is limited to certain users (Free and Go tiers) in the U.S. Additionally, ads are excluded from conversations involving sensitive topics such as health and politics to maintain service reliability, and ads are placed only in the area below the response body.

**Q: What should I do if I do not want to see any ads?**

A: Advertisements are not displayed when using existing paid subscription plans (Plus, Team, Enterprise, etc.). The introduction of ads is primarily a strategy to expand accessibility for free users and preserve the profitability of low-cost models (Go tier).

### Conclusion: An Inevitable Choice for AI Democratization

OpenAI's introduction of advertising is an inevitable step for AI technology to move beyond the laboratory and establish itself as a sustainable business. While positive effects of lowering the threshold so that anyone can use high-performance AI are expected, success will depend on how core values like user trust and privacy are protected in the process. Whether ads embedded in the context of a conversation will become assistants that enhance the value of information or simply noise will be proven by future market reactions. Users have now entered an era where they must choose the 'price of intelligence' that suits their preferences, between monthly subscription fees and ads placed at the bottom of responses.
