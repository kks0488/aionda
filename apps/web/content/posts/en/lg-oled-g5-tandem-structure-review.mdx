The brightness war in the OLED TV market has reached a tipping point. The prejudice that "OLED is dim" has now become a relic of the past. With the 2025 flagship model, the OLED G5, LG Electronics has fundamentally redesigned the physical structure of the display, beginning to overwhelm even 'luminance'—the final stronghold of the Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) camp.

The LG G5 does more than just inherit the Micro Lens Array (MLA) technology of its predecessor, the G4; it has completely replaced the heart of the panel with a 'Primary RGB Tandem (4-stack)' structure. This is not merely a specification upgrade, but the result of a complete redesign of how each individual pixel emits light.

### A Generational Shift in High-End OLED: The Numerical Victory of Tandem Structure

While the G4 boosted luminance by controlling light paths with lens technology, the G5 amplifies light output by layering the light-emitting levels. According to laboratory test data, the G5 achieved approximately a 40% improvement in full-screen (100% Window) luminance compared to the G4. This means it has surpassed the threshold where clear images can be viewed in broad daylight without closing the curtains.

Specific measurement figures are even more striking. The peak luminance in Filmmaker Mode recorded approximately 2,268 nits, and in Vivid Mode, which maximizes picture enhancement features, it reaches up to 2,900 nits. Considering that the G4's peak luminance sat in the low 2,000-nit range, this is a level of difference that is immediately perceptible to the eye. In particular, as a waypoint on the future technology roadmap aiming for 4,000 nits, the standard measurements of around 2,500 nits shown by the G5 provide more than enough headroom to handle existing HDR content.

However, not all models enjoy these benefits equally. According to investigations, it remains unclear whether the 48-inch and 97-inch models utilize this new Tandem panel, or if the scope of application differs. For consumers looking for either a massive screen or a size that doubles as a desktop monitor, this performance variance is expected to be a key variable.

### α11 AI Processor Gen2: Artificial Intelligence 'Painting' the Picture

If the hardware gained muscle through the Tandem panel, the brain controlling it is the α11 AI Processor Gen2. This engine, enhanced over its predecessor, goes beyond simple upscaling to realize pixel-level object recognition technology. The AI analyzes 1.6 billion image settings in real-time, separating subjects from backgrounds to apply optimized textures and contrast to each.

The progress is particularly notable in processing low-resolution video. It tracks and removes blocking artifacts and noise at the pixel level, which are common in low-bitrate streaming videos. However, some user communities, such as Reddit, have voiced that the differences can be difficult to perceive in actual use due to conflicts between the TV engine and the internal software correction algorithms of apps like YouTube. How harmoniously the hardware's computational power integrates with the software ecosystem is expected to be a core challenge for future firmware updates.

Gaming performance has also advanced. The G5 appeals to high-end PC gamers by supporting a 165Hz refresh rate. With high refresh rates added to OLED's characteristic near-infinite contrast ratio, it presents a powerful alternative for users of FPS or racing games who are sensitive to response speeds.

### Technical Sophistication and the Shadow of the Successor G6

The LG G5 is near the pinnacle in terms of technical completeness. It has successfully integrated the four-layer Tandem OLED structure into large TVs, and the sophistication of the AI processor has matured. However, the timing of purchase is somewhat complicated. As of January 20, 2026, the successor model G6, recently unveiled at CES 2026, is already garnering market expectations.

According to manufacturer announcements, the G6 is expected to improve brightness by an additional 20% compared to the G5 and significantly enhance anti-reflection capabilities, which have been a persistent issue. If the G5 opened the door for the Tandem structure, the G6 enters the stage of optimizing that structure to maximize efficiency. For consumers looking to purchase a G5 now, it would be a wise strategy to monitor the price drop of the G5 following the reveal of the G6.

Furthermore, whether DTS decoding support—which was removed in the G5—will return in the G6 remains unconfirmed, which is a consideration for audio enthusiasts. At this point, the G5 is more than worthy of the title "brightest and most sophisticated OLED," but the pace of technological development is currently outstripping the speed of consumer purchasing decisions.

### FAQ: Essential Checklist Before Purchasing the LG OLED G5

**Q1: Is there a practical reason for G4 users to upgrade to the G5?**
A: Yes, if your viewing environment is primarily during the day. The 40% improvement in 100% Window luminance completely changes visibility in bright living rooms. However, if your primary goal is watching movies in a dark room, the G4’s black levels and contrast are sufficient, and the perceived difference in AI engine upscaling may vary depending on the content source.

**Q2: What should I be careful of when buying 48-inch and 97-inch models?**
A: Research suggests that the new Tandem panel may not have been applied to certain small and ultra-large models. In these cases, you might not fully benefit from the 40% luminance boost that is the G5's core selling point. Therefore, you must individually verify the panel specifications for those specific sizes before purchasing.

**Q3: Does the G5's Tandem panel help with durability?**
A: Theoretically, yes. The Tandem structure stacks multiple organic layers, dispersing the electrical load on each layer when producing the same level of brightness. This can have a positive effect on delaying burn-in caused by element degradation, though actual long-term durability can only be clearly determined after real-world usage data has accumulated.

### Conclusion: The Peak of OLED, But Price is Key

The LG OLED G5 has successfully invaded the 'high-luminance' territory—once the exclusive domain of LCDs—through the physical innovation of the Tandem panel. Peak luminance reaching nearly 2,900 nits and the sophisticated control of the α11 AI Processor Gen2 provide the highest-tier experience current display technology can offer.

However, the additional performance improvements and anti-reflection technology promised by the G6, unveiled at CES 2026, are the largest external variables determining the G5's value proposition. If you want to experience an OLED with overwhelming brightness right now, the G5 is an excellent choice. But for consumers who prioritize price efficiency, it is necessary to approach strategically by watching price fluctuations before and after the G6 release.
