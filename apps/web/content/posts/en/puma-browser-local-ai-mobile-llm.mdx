## TL;DR
- Puma Browser runs local AI models on mobile devices using the MLC LLM framework.
- WebGPU acceleration and quantization enable offline responses and help protect user data.
- Users can select various small language models based on device specs and specific tasks.

Example: Someone sits in a plane with no internet and opens a mobile phone. They ask for a summary of a text file. The summary appears on the screen fast. This happens using only internal parts without sending data to other computers.

Smartphone chips process questions instead of remote data centers. AI provides answers in places like underground parking lots. Puma Browser moves AI tasks from the cloud to personal devices. This shift returns data control to individuals.

## Current Status: An AI Lab in Your Hand
Puma Browser offers a local AI environment for mobile phones. It uses the MLC LLM framework as a core. Users can install various open models like Llama 3.2 or Phi-3. It also supports Qwen and Gemma variants.

Technical tools like WebGPU acceleration help text generation speeds. Quantization reduces memory use while keeping precision. This helps manage battery life on different devices. On January 16, 2026, Puma offered models from small to medium sizes.

## Analysis: Freedom from Cloud Dependency
Manufacturers often limit models in tools like Chrome or Safari. Puma Browser allows more freedom in model selection. Users choose models based on performance or task needs. This integrates the AI ecosystem into the browser interface.

Security is a primary feature. Local AI follows a zero knowledge principle. Conversation data does not go to corporate servers for training. This setup helps users who handle sensitive information. A Web3 payment system also exists to support privacy.

Local devices have less power than cloud servers. Complex reasoning might face constraints. Installation requires local storage space. Performance varies based on available memory and update policies.

## Practical Application: Utilizing On-Device AI
Local AI browsers act as personal knowledge tools. They work well with unstable internet. These tools help with private documents or personal notes.

**Checklist for Today:**
- Review the memory capacity of your device to select a model that fits well.
- Test the speed of the AI in airplane mode to verify offline task performance.
- Look at the wallet settings in the browser to understand privacy payment options.

## FAQ
**Q: Does local AI drain the battery?**
A: Battery use increases because the device performs all calculations. Puma uses WebGPU and quantization to improve efficiency.

**Q: Which model is best?**
A: Small models work for simple summaries or translations. Larger models can handle complex logic if the device has enough memory.

**Q: How do updates work?**
A: The browser supports model delivery through the MLC LLM framework. Users can download new models from the internal menu.

## Conclusion
Puma Browser shifts AI from a connection model to an ownership model. Internal computation offers an alternative for security and speed. Better mobile chips will likely expand these capabilities. Users can choose an AI environment based on security and freedom.
