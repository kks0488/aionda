ERP is no longer a digital cabinet where data remains dormant. The era of entering vouchers and waiting for approval is passing; an era of 'autonomous systems' that detect business events, place purchase orders, and manage inventory has arrived. The history of ERP, which has evolved through mainframes, client-server models, and the cloud, has now reached a major turning point: the 'agent-centric architecture.' This is not merely a functional improvement but a process in which the corporate operating system itself is being transformed from a 'System of Record' into a 'System of Action.'

## From Recording Databases to Acting Data Layers

In the past, ERP managed structured data confined within the solid walls of Relational Databases (RDBMS). However, in an ERP environment driven by autonomous agents, traditional RDBMS face limitations. For agents to understand business context and process unstructured data (emails, contracts, voice, etc.), the data structure itself must change.

Currently, the industry is adopting methods to integrate or extend RDBMS with Vector Databases (Vector DB). This is intended to go beyond simply storing data as numbers and to build a foundation for 'semantic search' that identifies conceptual similarities. Through this intelligent data layer, agents detect business events occurring in real-time and respond immediately.

Furthermore, architectures are moving away from monolithic structures. There is a trend toward reorganizing into modular and composable data structures so that agents can perform tasks across various SaaS platforms and data sources. Companies like Google Cloud and SAP are already focusing on building environments where agents can secure real-time connectivity and maintain data integrity.

## The Weight of Autonomy: Where Does the Human Stand?

How much authority to grant to agents is the most sensitive issue facing every enterprise. The key here is 'dynamic allocation' based on risk and complexity. Entrusting all business processes to AI might be technically possible, but it is managerially risky.

Experts recommend the 'Human-in-the-loop' (HITL) model for high-value decision-making involving significant financial loss or legal and ethical responsibility. In this approach, AI suggests the optimal alternative, but a human presses the final approval button. Conversely, tasks such as simple repetitive inventory replenishment or low-risk expenditure approvals are transitioning to 'Human-on-the-loop' (HOTL) systems, where agents are granted autonomy and humans manage only the overall flow.

However, a 'golden ratio' of autonomy versus human approval that applies to all industries does not yet exist. Rather than a numerical answer like 7:3 or 8:2, success depends on how sophisticatedly the exception-handling mechanisms—where agents proactively request human intervention in low-confidence situations—are designed.

## Order in the Era of Multi-Agents: Communication Protocols

Within an enterprise, there are numerous departments, and specialized agents will operate in each. When a procurement agent orders raw materials, the finance agent must prepare the payment, and the logistics agent must set the receiving schedule. To collaborate without conflict, they need a common language.

Standard communication protocols such as Agent Communication Protocol (ACP) or Agent-to-Agent (A2A) currently fulfill this role. They synchronize the state between agents and standardize data formats to maintain the integrity of the entire system. In particular, key technologies emerging include placing a separate monitor called a 'verification agent' to cross-check transactions between agents or normalizing data in real-time through an integrated Master Data Management (MDM) agent.

However, the detailed implementation of 'distributed transaction locking' mechanisms to prevent data corruption when processing complex transactions between departmental agents remains a technical challenge.

## Practical Application: What Should Enterprises Prepare?

The transition to agent-centric ERP is not an explosion that happens all at once, but rather a gradual infiltration. Corporate IT decision-makers do not need to discard existing ERP systems immediately. Instead, the following step-by-step approach can serve as a practical alternative.

First, while maintaining the existing RDBMS environment, vector search functions for processing unstructured data should be partially introduced. Second, identify 'low-risk, high-repetition' processes where agent intervention can yield the greatest efficiency. For example, anomaly detection in Supply Chain Management (SCM) or automated expense processing are good starting points.

Third, data governance must be reorganized. Agents are only as smart as the quality of the data. If master data is in disarray, agents will rush toward the wrong conclusions faster than anyone else. Just as autonomous vehicles require clean road signs, autonomous agents require refined data.

## FAQ

**Q: Will traditional Relational Databases (RDBMS) disappear if agentic ERP is introduced?**  
A: No. RDBMS will still serve as the core repository for structured data. However, they will undergo changes such as being combined with vector databases or being expanded into intelligent data layers that agents can understand.

**Q: Is it safe for AI agents to proceed with payments without human approval?**  
A: There is a trend toward granting autonomy for low-risk, repetitive tasks. However, for high-value or high-risk decisions, the standard safety mechanism is to maintain a 'Human-in-the-loop' structure where the agent proposes and a human approves.

**Q: Is there a possibility of conflict between agents from different departments?**  
A: Yes, it exists. To prevent this, communication protocols between agents like ACP are used. Additionally, dedicated verification agents or Master Data Management (MDM) agents are deployed to monitor and coordinate the data integrity of the entire system in real-time.

## The Era of Autonomous Driving for Business

The evolution of ERP has ultimately been a history of 'how far human intervention can be reduced.' While in the past, time was spent entering data, we are now in an era of managing the results of decisions made by agents. Agent-centric ERP promises enterprises 'operational autonomy' beyond simple automation. However, the foundation of that autonomy must ultimately be built upon a sophisticatedly designed data architecture and a system of human strategic oversight. The autonomous driving of business has only just begun.
