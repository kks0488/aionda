## TL;DR
- Open-source models like Qwen and Grok are achieving performance levels similar to closed systems.
- This shift allows businesses to prioritize data control and cost-efficiency.
- Users should validate high-performance open models on internal infrastructure to determine operational costs.

Example: A software development team installs a model on their own server to generate code with complex logical structures. This allows them to avoid sending information to external networks. Tasks previously possible only through commercial services now operate smoothly within the internal network.

## Current Status
As technical performance in the Large Language Model market levels out, boundaries between closed and open models blur. The Qwen 2.5 series from Alibaba trained on 18 trillion tokens. It recorded a score of 86.1 on the MMLU language understanding metric. This performance follows the achievement of Qwen2-72B-Instruct on the Open LLM Leaderboard. The architecture uses a Transformer structure with Grouped Query Attention for efficient inference. It also includes RMSNorm and the SwiGLU activation function for stability. This model supports a 128K token context and generates outputs up to 8K tokens.

Grok-1 uses a Mixture-of-Experts architecture with 314 billion parameters, activating two experts per token. While official architecture details for Grok-2 have not been fully disclosed by xAI, it aims for a balance between performance and speed alongside Google's multimodal Gemini models.

## Analysis
These shifts change the idea that closed models possess a permanent technical edge. Qwen benchmark scores suggest open models narrow the gap with proprietary systems. Enterprises can consider operating their own models instead of paying API costs. This approach also reduces the risk of data leaks. Architectural diversification is now prominent. Mixture-of-Experts structures like Grok-2 focus on high inference speeds. Qwen 2.5 used 18 trillion training tokens to enhance inference performance. Some technical details remain undisclosed. Parameters for Qwen 2.5-Max and Grok-2 training data are not fully specified. Users should review benchmark figures alongside actual operational costs. Hardware requirements also need careful evaluation.

## Practical Application
Developers and architects can select models based on environment constraints and data types. Lightweight models like Qwen 2.5-7B-Instruct suit on-device or edge computing. Large-scale data analysis may favor a 72B model on internal GPU clusters. This choice can be economical for some organizations.

**Checklist for Today:**
- Download the Qwen 2.5-7B-Instruct model and measure local inference speed and memory use.
- Compare commercial API costs with the maintenance expenses of an internal 72B model.
- Test document summarization for long texts to ensure no information is lost at the end.

## FAQ
**Q: How does the Qwen 2.5 architecture differ from previous versions?**
**A:** It uses 18 trillion tokens to improve multilingual and coding performance. It also uses Grouped Query Attention to improve memory efficiency.

**Q: What advantages does the MoE approach of Grok-2 offer?**
**A:** It uses only a portion of parameters to increase response speed. This helps ensure efficiency in environments with large traffic.

**Q: What metrics are important when choosing an open-source model?**
**A:** One should verify output limits and context window sizes. Qwen supports 8K output and 128K input for business workflows.

## Conclusion
The LLM market has moved from a monopoly to efficiency competition. Alibaba, Google, and xAI now provide alternatives to closed models. Success depends on optimization for the operating environment and domain. Inference efficiency and data control will likely influence future market choices.
