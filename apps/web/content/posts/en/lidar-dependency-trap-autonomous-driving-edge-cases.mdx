# The Pitfall of LiDAR Dependency: The Explosion of Edge Cases Facing Autonomous Driving Sensor Strategies

When autonomous driving systems rely too heavily on LiDAR sensors, they fall into a swamp of unpredictable complexity. The core issue is that as sensors increase, the number of exception cases—edge cases—that must be managed grows exponentially. Furthermore, while camera errors can often be corrected by human intuition, physical signal errors from LiDAR or ultrasonic sensors are much more difficult to diagnose and fix.

## Current Status: Investigated Facts and Data

Each sensor reveals unique weaknesses. For cameras, recognition performance plummets to about 75% at night or in bad weather. LiDAR shows characteristics where its effective range decreases to about 33% of normal when detecting low-reflectivity objects, such as black vehicles. Radar, on the other hand, is robust against weather conditions, but its low resolution makes small object identification difficult and can cause phantom braking.

Recognizing these limitations, the industry is already applying new approaches. Mercedes-Benz's Level 3 'DRIVE PILOT' and NVIDIA's 'DRIVE Hyperion' platform use cameras and radar as their main pillars. In these systems, LiDAR serves as a safety redundancy and a supplementary sensor that provides precise distance and speed information in conditions where cameras are vulnerable, such as backlighting or bad weather.

## Analysis: Meaning and Impact

The root causes of LiDAR signal errors can be largely categorized into two types. The first is environmental interference such as rain, fog, and solar glare noise. The second is physical and systematic limitations like signal crosstalk between sensors or low reflectivity. While camera-based perception errors often appear in a form understandable to humans (e.g., blurry images), signal loss or noise occurring in LiDAR's raw point cloud is much more complex to diagnose and correct at its root cause.

The latest research on this is evolving in both hardware and software directions. On the hardware side, the shift to FMCW (Frequency-Modulated Continuous Wave) LiDAR, which is robust to interference, is gaining attention. On the software side, deep learning-based point cloud denoising techniques and reflectance restoration algorithms are being actively developed, continuing efforts to improve data quality in adverse weather conditions.

## Practical Application: Methods Readers Can Utilize

When evaluating or discussing autonomous driving technology, focus should be placed on **sensor fusion strategy** and **the system's philosophy for managing edge cases**, rather than the absolute performance of a single sensor. The architecture of which sensor is considered 'primary' and which sensor supplements or replaces it in which situation is key to safety. Also, it is more important to question what role the sensor actually plays in the system's decision-making loop than whether LiDAR is present or not.

## FAQ: 3 Questions

**Q: So, is LiDAR an unnecessary sensor for autonomous driving?**
A: No. LiDAR provides precise 3D terrain information and more stable distance measurements under certain conditions that cameras and radar cannot provide. The key lies in the strategy of utilizing it not as the 'sole source of truth' but as a 'powerful supplementary source of evidence.'

**Q: Why is safe autonomous driving impossible with cameras alone?**
A: Due to the inherent limitations of optical sensors, cameras have errors in depth estimation, and their performance significantly degrades under extreme lighting (backlight, darkness) or weather conditions. Radar or LiDAR enhance the system's robustness by directly measuring physical distance and speed under these conditions.

**Q: Is there no way to completely eliminate edge cases?**
A: Considering the infinite diversity of the real world, it is impossible to eliminate all edge cases in advance. Therefore, the current focus of research and development is on minimizing edge cases while equipping the system with the ability to safely handle (minimum risk maneuver) unexpected situations it encounters.

## Conclusion: Summary + Actionable Advice

LiDAR has broadened the horizons of autonomous driving, but viewing it as a universal primary sensor risks system complexity and undiagnosable errors. The future of successful autonomous driving depends not on a breakthrough in a single sensor technology, but on an intelligent architecture that understands the strengths of cameras, radar, and LiDAR and combines them complementarily. The next time you encounter an autonomous driving system, the insightful question needed is not 'what sensors are equipped?' but 'how do those sensors work together to navigate edge cases?'
