## TL;DR

- Defense AI procurement often hinges on deployment, logging, retention, and accountability before model performance.  
- Prepare logging architecture, data-rights packaging, and an incident runbook before contract drafts circulate.  

---

Numbers like **72 hours**, **90 days**, and a **5-year** period often shift procurement conversations toward operations.  
The conversation can move from model accuracy to evidence and accountability.  
Common questions include “Where do the logs go?” and “Who retains the data?”.  
Incident response questions can increase contract risk, even after a strong demo.  

The core issue is straightforward.  
In defense AI procurement, operational design can face contract review before the model does.  
Operational design includes deployment, access control, logging, retention, and accountability.  
Procurement clauses can also drive changes in technical operations.  

Example: A team shows a polished demo in a secure setting. The discussion shifts to audit trails and incident response. The team describes safeguards, yet the evidence story remains unclear. The group focuses on accountability rather than model quality.

## Current state

AI/ML procurement in defense and government often appears tied to existing security frameworks.  
This summary relies on the cited search results and the text below.  
It appears less focused on standalone AI-only control items.  
It appears more focused on layering AI on top of existing controls.  

Systems often follow the DoD Cloud Computing SRG Impact Level structure.  
The baseline is often **FedRAMP**, which is based on **NIST SP 800-53** controls.  
DoD can add requirements such as **FedRAMP+** or **General Readiness (GR)**.  
This investigation did not confirm an AI/ML-only list of mandatory control numbers.  
That conclusion may need additional verification.  

Several standards and guides recommend an overlay approach.  
That approach adapts existing controls to AI risks.  
NIST describes work that tailors or augments SP 800-53 for AI systems.  
It highlights concerns such as model integrity and data provenance.  
It also notes adversarial robustness and transparency.  
A statement like “we comply with 800-53” can be insufficient in practice.  
It can trigger requests to explain how 800-53 was applied to AI operations.  

Contract clauses can be more direct than general frameworks.  
They can affect data rights, incident response, and quality inspection.  
FAR 52.227-14 can grant the government **unlimited rights** to data first produced under a contract.  
DFARS 252.227-7013 divides technical data rights into several categories.  
Those include unlimited rights, government purpose rights, and limited rights.  
DFARS 252.227-7013 includes a **government purpose rights 5-year period**.  
DFARS 252.204-7012 requires cyber incident reporting **within 72 hours**.

## Analysis

Tension often appears between data minimization and auditability.  
Commercial AI teams often prefer minimizing retained data for privacy or security.  
Defense procurement often asks for evidence suitable for audits and investigations.  
These goals may not align without careful design.  

A practical response is to define the minimum audit evidence.  
That evidence should be retained securely.  
Access privileges can be separated by design.  

NIST NCCoE Practice Guides, in the SP 1800 series, offer a documentation pattern.  
They combine architecture with operational capabilities.  
Examples include event detection and monitoring.  
They also include log collection, collation, and correlation.  
They add Security and Privacy Characteristic Analysis and privacy scenarios.  
The approach links “we keep logs” to specific purposes and controls.  
It can also document how privacy risk was reduced.  

This work can slow product teams.  
Procurement clauses can appear as evidence and retention requirements.  
They can also require markings and reproducibility.  
FAR 52.246-4 allows remedies if services fail requirements.  
It also calls for an inspection system acceptable to the government.  
It can require retaining and providing inspection records.  
In AI systems, “inspection records” can expand into operational metadata.  
Examples include model versions, configuration, and deployment history.  
This point is a general observation and may vary by contract.  
Without preparation, the issue can shift into contract performance risk.

## Practical application

The practical goal is to align architecture, operations, and contract language.  
This alignment often works better as a single bundle.  
DFARS 252.204-7012 includes reporting **within 72 hours**.  
A plan like “security will handle it” can be too vague.  
The process can be standardized as a sequence.  
One sequence is detection, triage, scoping, evidence collection, and reporting.  

The **at least 90 days** retention requirement is not only storage capacity.  
It can become a data governance requirement.  
It can include access control, key management, and deletion policy.  

Data rights can also create operational design constraints.  
FAR 52.227-14 includes **unlimited rights** for data first produced under the contract.  
This can interact with questions about training data boundaries.  
That interpretation often needs legal review.  
DFARS 252.227-7013 anticipates attaching legends to distinguish rights categories.  
Packaging deliverables by rights category can reduce confusion.  
It can also reduce accidental over-disclosure risk.  
This can include separating creation, storage, and export paths.  

**Checklist for Today:**
- Draft a one-page incident runbook that targets DFARS 252.204-7012 reporting within **72 hours**.  
- Document evidence scope and controls that support retention for **at least 90 days**, including permissions and deletion.  
- Define deliverable packaging rules using legends under FAR 52.227-14 and DFARS 252.227-7013.

## FAQ

**Q1. Are there separate security controls DoD requires specifically “because it is AI/ML”?**  
A. This investigation did not confirm an AI/ML-only mandatory control number list.  
That conclusion may need additional verification.  
The material suggests AI risks get handled as overlays on FedRAMP and DoD additions.  
Examples mentioned include 800-53-based controls and additions like FedRAMP+.  

**Q2. Can data minimization and audit logs coexist?**  
A. They can coexist, but they often require explicit design choices.  
NIST NCCoE Practice Guides, in the SP 1800 series, illustrate one approach.  
They define logging and monitoring capabilities in architecture documentation.  
They also document why specific logs are needed.  
They can pair that with privacy analyses and minimization principles.  

**Q3. What are the largest “minimum requirements” procurement clauses force into actual operations?**  
A. The clearest quantitative requirements here are in DFARS 252.204-7012.  
They include incident reporting within **72 hours**.  
They also include evidence retention for **at least 90 days**.  
FAR 52.246-4 also emphasizes an acceptable inspection system and inspection records.
