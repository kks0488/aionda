# When Will AI Replace Your Job? The Deciding Factors Are 'Data' and 'Economic Viability'

The replacement of jobs by AI is not a simple technological competition. The order of replacement is determined at the intersection of technological feasibility and economic utility, and the first gate, surprisingly, is the availability of abundant, standardized data. This framework leads to the paradoxical prediction that software-based, high-income professional jobs will be replaced first, while complex, low-wage manual labor will be replaced last.

## Current Status: Investigated Facts and Data

The legal field has already built a significant portion of the data infrastructure needed for AI replacement. Through the domestic Public Data Portal and AI-Hub, over approximately 300,000 court case data points and about 7 million pieces of legislation and administrative ruling information are publicly available in machine-readable formats like JSON and XML. In contrast, while the medical imaging field also has hundreds of thousands of disease-specific data points on AI-Hub, sensitive personal information requires research approval procedures or limited access through specific secure zones. The level of data standardization and accessibility varies significantly across professions.

Regarding the economics of replacement, numerous studies compare robot introduction costs and labor costs. Analysis combining robot price data from the International Federation of Robotics and national wage data indicates that the relative price decline of robots is already exerting a suppressing effect on wages in certain skilled occupations. However, precise cost-to-salary comparison data for the non-manufacturing service sector is relatively scarce.

Sim2Real and World Models, key technologies for replacing physical jobs, are accelerating the timeline by solving data bottlenecks. A recent MIT study showed that robot learning speed through real-time digital twins has accelerated by tens of times. One economic modeling study predicts that such technological leaps will bring a tipping point around 2030-2032 when robot labor costs fall below the human minimum wage.

## Analysis: Meaning and Impact

These findings suggest that the focus of the job replacement debate should shift from technical difficulty to 'ease of data learning.' The rapid AI advancement in the legal field is not due to superior technology but to the abundance of publicly available, standardized data. Conversely, complex manual labor like cleaning or childcare, which is easy for humans, will face long-term entry barriers for AI and robots due to the difficulty of data collection and standardization.

Therefore, the timing of replacement is determined not by a single factor but at the convergence point of supply (technological feasibility) and demand (economic utility). High-income professional jobs secure replacement economic viability through high labor cost differentials, and software-based tasks are automated quickly because data collection and standardization are relatively easier. This means, contrary to popular belief, that lower wage levels do not necessarily lead to earlier replacement.

## Practical Application: Methods the Reader Can Use

To assess when and how your job will be affected by AI, examine two axes. First, how much of your work can be standardized and accumulated as digital data? Second, what is the level of introduction and operational cost for solutions automating that work compared to your annual salary?

According to this framework, non-standardized creativity difficult to digitize, complex interpersonal coordination, and the ability to handle unpredictable physical environments are likely to be protected in the medium to long term. On the other hand, standardized document writing, pattern-based analysis, and formulaic judgments will face replacement pressure regardless of income level.

## FAQ: 3 Questions

**Q: Does this mean high-income professionals like doctors or lawyers will be replaced before factory workers?**
A: For specific task areas, yes. Professional tasks that can be learned from standardized data (e.g., legal precedent analysis, radiological image interpretation) and can offset robot introduction costs through high labor cost differentials become automation targets first due to economic incentives. However, this means a partial change in work, not complete replacement.

**Q: Will robots really work cheaper than the human minimum wage one day?**
A: Previous studies anticipate that robot labor costs will drop sharply due to technological advances like Sim2Real. Some economic modeling predicts that tipping point could arrive in the early 2030s for specific repetitive manual labor fields, but the exact timing heavily depends on the pace of technological advancement and the rate of mass production cost reduction.

**Q: If the data for my job is hard to standardize, is it safe?**
A: In the short term, it belongs to a safer domain. However, Sim2Real technology, designed to overcome 'Moravec's paradox,' is breaking down this barrier by generating and learning vast amounts of complex data from the physical world in simulation environments. The difficulty of data standardization only buys time; it will not be a permanent shield.

## Conclusion: Summary + Actionable Advice

The order of job replacement by AI is determined at the point where supply-side factors (abundance and ease of standardization of data) and demand-side factors (automation cost compared to labor cost) intersect. Diagnosing where your domain lies on this coordinate plane is the first step. Your immediate action is simple: begin an analysis to distinguish which components of your work are easily convertible into standardized data and which are not. Invest in the latter.
