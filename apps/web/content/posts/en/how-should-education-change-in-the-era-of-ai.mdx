AI education currently assumes technical limitations are fixed constants. This is a dangerous approach that overlooks the essence of technological acceleration. Instead of teaching "how to filter out average answers," educational environments must teach how to adapt to change itself.

## The Trap of Static Technical Levels
Current discourse on AI education defines LLMs as "products of the average." However, the reasoning capabilities of artificial intelligence are advancing leaps and bounds every month. Curricula designed based on today’s limitations will become obsolete before students even graduate. We must strive to hit a moving target.

## The Short Shelf Life of Fact-Checking Education
Teaching techniques to verify hallucinations is merely a stopgap measure. Once model reliability crosses a critical threshold, the value of this training will plummet. It is a waste of resources to provide education that merely compensates for technical flaws at a specific point in time. Understanding the structural principles of the system is far more important.

## Social Misconceptions Regarding Acceleration
Experts and parents often formulate educational strategies while feeling a sense of relief regarding current AI performance levels. However, technology grows exponentially, not linearly. The speed of textbook production can never catch up with the pace of AI advancement. Static knowledge transfer is no longer valid.

## The Fundamental Value of Critical Thinking
Adopting a critical stance toward information remains important. It is essential to avoid blind faith in the outputs generated by AI. However, this should not be confined to the narrow framework of "filtering average responses." Logical reasoning from a broader perspective is the core requirement.

## Designing Education for a Flexible Future
Attempting to teach the usage of specific tools is a futile effort. We must foster the ability to engage in self-directed learning within a shifting technological landscape. Students should not just learn how to evaluate technology, but how to co-evolve with it. Flexibility is the only survival strategy in the age of AI.
