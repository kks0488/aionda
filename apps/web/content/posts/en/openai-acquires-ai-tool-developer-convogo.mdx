OpenAI unveiled 'o1' on September 12, a new AI model with enhanced reasoning capabilities. This model solves complex scientific and mathematical problems by "thinking" through them autonomously. It demonstrated significant technical progress by achieving an 83% accuracy rate in the American Invitational Mathematics Examination (AIME) qualifiers.

## Why It Matters
o1 mimics the human thought process. Instead of providing an immediate response, it constructs step-by-step logic. This is particularly useful in fields requiring high precision, such as semiconductor design and drug discovery.

In comparison, the existing GPT-4o model achieved an accuracy rate of only 13% on the same mathematics exam. [OpenAI's technical report](https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/) provides specific figures illustrating the improvement in reasoning performance. The model also performed on par with human experts in PhD-level physics examinations.

## Background
The industry has historically focused on increasing the size of AI models. However, simple scaling has faced limitations due to a shortage of high-quality data. OpenAI introduced reinforcement learning techniques that allow the model to review its own computational processes.

This technology is known as "Chain of Thought." Before delivering an answer, the model internally corrects errors and explores alternatives. The enhancement of reasoning capabilities is regarded as a key factor in increasing the reliability of AI-generated responses.

## Outlook
The debut of o1 marks a milestone on the path toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Google and Anthropic have also announced upcoming competitive models featuring advanced reasoning functions.

AI is now evolving beyond simple information summarization into a partner capable of solving complex engineering problems. Enterprises have begun to invest more in the logical accuracy of AI-generated results rather than just the speed of output.
