A single developer translated 7,700 lines of dialogue in just 40 hours. A task that once took a professional team months of effort was completed in two days. Your projects can now also be completed instantly using AI.

## What Happened
A developer has fully localized the classic game *Ultima VI* into Korean by leveraging the latest AI tools, including Claude and Gemini. All 7,700 lines of dialogue and 600 items were translated. The entire process—including code modifications and font rendering—took only 40 hours.

## Why It Matters
AI is completely dismantling the limitations of solo developers. Large-scale localization is now possible without a dedicated team of translators and programmers. The time and cost required for content production have been drastically reduced.

## Background
*Ultima VI* is an RPG renowned for its vast amount of text. Historically, fans spent years creating Korean patches for such titles. This project used Python to extract data and handed the translation over to AI. The AI accurately reproduced the archaic prose style characteristic of medieval fantasy.

## Future Outlook
A surge of classic games with language barriers removed is expected. Small-scale development studios can now respond to global markets immediately. Humans will now focus on final reviews rather than repetitive manual tasks.

## FAQ
**Q: Is the AI translation natural?**
A: By providing sufficient context, AI can accurately reproduce even archaic literary styles.

**Q: Did the developer write the code directly?**
A: AI handled the modifications for the C++ and Lua code.

**Q: What were the project costs?**
A: No additional labor costs were incurred beyond the AI API usage fees.
