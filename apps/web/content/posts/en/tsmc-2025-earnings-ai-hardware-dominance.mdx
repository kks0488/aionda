Silicon does not lie. Whenever "AI bubble theories" have been raised in the software market, investors have sought to verify the reality through hardware, and TSMC provided that answer through its Q4 2025 earnings report. This performance is a powerful indicator proving that the global technology infrastructure is being reorganized around AI, moving beyond simple profit growth.

### Record-Breaking Performance Driven by Advanced Process Nodes

TSMC's performance in the fourth quarter of 2025 demonstrates the depth of the market's thirst for advanced semiconductor processes. The share of advanced nodes of 7nm and below accounted for a staggering 77% of total revenue. In particular, the 3nm process led growth, with its revenue share rising to 28% compared to the previous quarter. This indicates that demand for AI accelerators and next-generation smartphone chipsets, which require high-performance computing, is rapidly converging on the 3nm process.

Positive signals were also captured in terms of yield, an indicator of production efficiency. The 2nm (N2) process, which began mass production in the fourth quarter, is recording healthy yields despite being in its early stages. Even more noteworthy is the performance of the Arizona fab in the United States, which had been a source of significant geopolitical concern. The 4nm yield at this facility is currently on par with or even exceeding that of the main plants in Taiwan, silencing market doubts regarding overseas production bases.

High Performance Computing (HPC) has now firmly established itself as TSMC's core engine. According to the 2025 annual results, HPC revenue surged by 48% year-on-year, accounting for 58% of total revenue. This proves that TSMC's chips are in demand not only for AI accelerators but also across all computation-intensive fields, including government-led defense projects, life sciences, and big data analysis.

### Hardware Reality Silencing AI Bubble Theories

While some in the market warn of a bubble, citing that the profitability of AI services has not yet materialized, TSMC's supply chain data tells a different story. TSMC's share in the foundry market is expected to reach approximately 72% in 2026. Although second-placed Samsung Electronics is in pursuit, accelerating improvements in its 2nm (SF2) process yield with an 8% market share, reservation rates for advanced nodes remain concentrated at TSMC.

TSMC plans to expand its AI accelerator production capacity by approximately 80% year-on-year in 2026. This stems from confidence that the craze for building national-level AI infrastructure is not a temporary fad but a sustained trend. Exascale computing programs being promoted across the US and Asia, along with HPC demand in the life sciences sector (projected at a compound annual growth rate of 9.54%), are forming a solid floor for hardware demand.

Of course, it is not all optimism. Initial cost expenditures following the operation of overseas fabs could lead to temporary margin dilution. Furthermore, the detailed customer allocation for the next-generation A16 process, scheduled for mass production in the second half of 2026, and intensifying competition from Samsung Electronics and Intel are challenges TSMC must address. However, for the time being, the market situation remains supplier-driven, as utilization rates for 3nm and 5nm processes are expected to remain high throughout 2026.

### What Corporations and Developers Should Prepare For

TSMC's supply chain dominance and capacity expansion send a clear message to technology companies.

First, proactive supply chain management to secure advanced nodes is essential. As the proportion of the 3nm process increases rapidly and the 2nm process enters full swing, companies requiring high-performance hardware should review long-term contract strategies to secure production slots.

Second, attention should be paid to the expansion of HPC-based application fields. Beyond simply chatbot services, new business opportunities can be captured in high-value-added computing areas that support TSMC's revenue growth, such as life sciences, meteorology, and financial simulation. In particular, the growth of HPC in the life sciences sector is a promising point where hardware performance can be converted into software value.

### FAQ

**Q: What is the actual mass production timing and yield for the 2nm process?**

A: According to TSMC's announcement, the 2nm process is currently progressing through its process stages with "healthy yields." While specific numerical yields are confidential, the Q4 2025 earnings announcement confirmed that preparations for initial mass production are proceeding smoothly.

**Q: How is the market share gap with competitors like Samsung Electronics changing?**

A: Based on 2026 projections, TSMC is expected to hold approximately 72% market share, while Samsung Electronics holds about 8%. Samsung Electronics is aiming for a rebound by improving the yield of its SF2 (2nm) process, while TSMC is attempting to maintain the gap by expanding its AI accelerator production capacity by 80%.

**Q: Are there other sectors driving growth besides AI accelerators?**

A: Within the HPC segment, the life sciences sector is projected to show a compound annual growth rate of 9.54%. Additionally, national AI infrastructure construction and exascale supercomputing programs are acting as major revenue drivers for TSMC alongside traditional cloud demand.

### Summary: The Future of AI Engraved in Silicon

TSMC's Q4 2025 results have confirmed that AI demand is moving beyond simple expectations toward actual infrastructure construction. The revenue share of advanced nodes reaching 77% and the plan to expand AI accelerator production capacity by nearly 80% demonstrate that TSMC is the unrivaled gatekeeper of the AI era. Market attention is now shifting toward the stabilization of the 2nm process, profitability management of overseas production bases, and the intensity of the pursuit by competitors like Samsung Electronics. The physical foundation of the AI revolution appears more solid than ever.
