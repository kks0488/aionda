## TL;DR
- IBM Enterprise Advantage connects AI projects through a software layer without replacing existing systems.
- The strategy addresses scalability by consolidating fragmented departmental initiatives into one operating framework.
- The framework focuses on business environment deployment and performance instead of just model development.

Many large-scale AI investments often struggle to produce actual results.
They frequently remain stuck in experimental phases.
Most companies succeed at the Proof of Concept stage.
However, scaling during production transitions can be difficult.
IBM proposed the 'IBM Enterprise Advantage' strategy.
This integrates scattered AI projects while maintaining current infrastructure.

## Current Status: AI Fragmentation Hindering Corporate Productivity
AI isolation is a primary issue for many companies today.
Varying tools and data structures can create scaling bottlenecks.
Marketing and development teams often use different models.
Companies seek AI capabilities while protecting established IT assets.
IBM Enterprise Advantage focuses on this specific challenge.
Its 'Services-as-Software' layer automates previously manual integration processes.
Companies can apply this layer over existing infrastructure.
It connects AI projects from different environments into one pipeline.
The strategy aims for cloud-agnostic flexibility.
It intends to reduce vendor lock-in concerns.
It gives companies control over segmented AI models.

## Analysis: Services Turned into Software
IBM aims to commoditize IT services through this move.
'Services-as-Software' turns AI application cases into code assets.
This could change the structure of future consulting costs.
Some considerations remain important for implementation.
Performance may decrease when combining layers with legacy systems.
Low data quality or fragmented security can diminish integration effects.
Interoperability with Microsoft or Google ecosystems remains a cautious point.
Lack of demonstrated compatibility might add another management layer.

## Practical Application: Preparations for Enterprises
Decision-makers should identify AI projects scattered within the company.
They can verify if automation features conflict with governance rules.
Teams should focus on layer integration instead of infrastructure replacement.
They can simulate the management layer over AWS or Azure environments.
A practical approach involves checking for latency and security vulnerabilities.

## FAQ
**Q: What specifically is 'Services-as-Software'?**
A: It implements consulting and operational knowledge into software code.
Software performs data integration and model deployment tasks.

**Q: Is replacement of existing clouds or models necessary?**
A: No.
It adds a management layer on top of current systems.
It utilizes existing infrastructure as it is.

**Q: Is this suitable for small and medium-sized enterprises?**
A: This solution targets large enterprises with fragmented projects.
Complex systems may see more significant impacts from adoption.

## Conclusion
IBM emphasizes operational efficiency over technical maturity.
Many companies focus on individual model performance.
IBM presents a method to connect models as business engines.
Success may depend on the versatility of the software model.
The market will evaluate if this layer resolves technical barriers.
