# AI's New Pattern in Solving Mathematical Conundrums: From Pointing Out Ambiguities to Chain Discoveries

AI is now emerging not merely as a computational tool but as a collaborative partner capable of pointing out and reconstructing ambiguities inherent in the very definition of mathematical problems. Recent research demonstrates AI's potential to lead from solving one problem to the chain resolution of related problems with similar mathematical structures, thereby transforming the methodology of mathematical research.

## Current Status: Investigated Facts and Data

The prize amounts and difficulty classifications for Erdős problems can be officially verified on Professor Fan Chung Graham's UCSD academic page and in her co-authored book with Ron Graham, 'Erdős on Graphs: His Legacy of Unsolved Problems'. Erdős assigned prizes ranging from $25 to $10,000 based on difficulty and importance, categorizing them with metaphors from marshmallows to acorns.

AI's role is prominent in these complex problems. AI systems have demonstrated the ability to modify proof methods for problems or discover errors in existing mathematical databases. More importantly, AI can accurately pinpoint ambiguities inherent in problem statements and propose clearer reformulations.

## Analysis: Meaning and Impact

AI's ability to point out ambiguities in problem definitions could revolutionize the early stages of mathematical research. Researchers often rely on implicit assumptions or incomplete definitions. When AI identifies these gaps, the problem itself can be redefined on a more solid foundation, paving the way for valid proofs.

The 'chain reaction' where solving one problem leads to solving others with similar structures is a phenomenon created by AI's pattern recognition capabilities. AI can compare and map abstract similarities on a large scale, which humans might easily overlook. This goes beyond solving individual problems to reveal networks of connections within mathematical fields and can contribute to building new theoretical frameworks.

## Practical Application: Methods Readers Can Utilize

Researchers or learners need to treat AI not as a simple solver but as a critical companion. When defining a new problem, input its statement into an AI system to seek feedback on logical flaws or ambiguous terms. This reduces errors at the problem-setting stage.

Input a previously solved problem into AI and ask, "What other unsolved problems have a structure similar to this proof?" The list of related problems generated by AI can provide unexpected connections, suggesting the next direction for research.

## FAQ

**Q: Are the prizes for Erdős problems still being paid?**
A: The prize system was established by Erdős and his collaborator Ron Graham. However, following Ron Graham's death in 2020, the ultimate authority managing prize payments or the current status of the fund's management has not been clearly confirmed from official sources.

**Q: What specifically does the 'ambiguity' pointed out by AI mean?**
A: It refers to cases where problem conditions are insufficient, term definitions are not rigorous, or assumptions are not explicitly stated, allowing for multiple interpretations. AI identifies these points to help refine the problem with mathematical rigor.

**Q: Are proofs aided by AI recognized in academia?**
A: The trend is toward increasing recognition. The key is that AI's role is verifiable and that human researchers understand the entire logical flow and take responsibility. AI serves as a tool that provides insights or performs tedious computations; the final responsibility for the proof still lies with human mathematicians.

## Conclusion

AI is now evolving from being a mere messenger of mathematics to an interpreter and connector. Its ability to illuminate ambiguities and reveal structural similarities will act as a catalyst for expanding networks of knowledge beyond solving single problems. It is time for mathematicians and researchers to begin a dialogue with this new collaborator.
