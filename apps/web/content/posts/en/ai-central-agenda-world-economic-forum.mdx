## TL;DR
- Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as the core agenda of the World Economic Forum (WEF).
Replacing traditional topics such as climate change and poverty.
- Information technology companies, including Meta and Salesforce, are leading the scene in Davos, transforming the forum into a tech-centric discussion platform.
- Global executives pointed out that national trade policies are hindering technological advancement and called for the establishment of international regulatory guidelines.

The heat of data centers can be felt in the air of Davos, Switzerland. The stage of the World Economic Forum has transformed into a venue for discussing who will determine the direction of AI technology, rather than challenges like climate change or poverty eradication. Technology has moved beyond merely influencing politics to become the core of global governance norms.

Example.
Imagine a scene where delegates walking through snow-covered streets queue up in front of specific corporate experience centers to discuss ways to secure compute resources, instead of carrying documents containing climate crisis response measures.

## Current Status
The landscape of this year's Davos Forum differs from previous years. Shops in downtown Davos are filled with the logos of companies like Meta and Salesforce. The voices of politicians and environmental activists have been sidelined by the statements of corporate executives explaining the potential and risks of technology. AI is being regarded as a strategic asset directly linked to national security, moving beyond mere technical progress.

Business leaders gathered at the scene expressed critical opinions on current trade policies. They argue that export controls or data barriers in specific countries hinder the universal diffusion of technology. As the speed of technological development outpaces the rate at which policymakers design regulations, a conflict has emerged between the opinion that regulation should not impede progress and the concern that uncontrollable technology should not be left unchecked.

Participants focused not only on the economic benefits technology will bring but also on how it will change the landscape of the international order. While climate change response was once a symbol of international cooperation, securing technological sovereignty has now become a survival strategy for each nation. Although specific regulatory plans or detailed figures for agreements have not been finalized, this forum clearly demonstrated that AI has become the central axis of global trade and diplomatic policy.

## Analysis
The transformation of Davos into a venue for technological discussion is an indicator showing the flow of capital and power. In the past, discussions centered on how to save the planet; now, who will hold technological leadership has become a national priority. AI has moved beyond being a general-purpose technology like electricity or the internet to become a benchmark that determines a nation's economic indicators and military strength.

There are several aspects to this shift. On the positive side, it has brought fragmented regulatory discussions from individual countries into an international arena. Criticism of trade policies has the potential to serve as an opportunity to create transparent global standards. However, there is a significant risk that fundamental issues such as the climate crisis or inequality will be overshadowed and marginalized by technological topics. In a situation dominated by tech-centric thinking, the voices of marginalized nations and classes are bound to diminish.

From a critical perspective, the actions shown by corporations in Davos are sometimes interpreted as activities intended to create a favorable regulatory environment. Criticism of trade policies may be a justification for the expansion of their own services. Whether technology remains a tool for solving humanity's problems or becomes a means of reinforcing new forms of digital inequality depends on the direction of future regulations.

## Practical Application
As policy emerges as a core element of global trade, companies and individuals should go beyond technical preparation to equip themselves with policy-response capabilities. Efforts are needed to reposition oneself within the changing international norms.

Hypothetical Example.
To prepare for a situation where a service developed in a specific country is suspended due to another country's data sovereignty laws, an operational structure should be designed that reflects the regulatory requirements of various regions.

**Today's Action Checklist:**
- Check whether the organization's technology utilization guidelines align with current international ethical and regulatory trends.
- Secure a dedicated channel to monitor major countries' technology-related export/import restrictions and trade policy changes.
- Initiate a legal review regarding data sovereignty and privacy issues that may arise during technology adoption.

## FAQ
**Q: Why was AI treated as more important than climate change in Davos?**
A: Because it is directly linked to economic interests. While climate change is a long-term challenge, technology is perceived as an urgent issue that immediately determines corporate productivity and national competitiveness. Furthermore, as the logic spreads that technology can be a tool for solving climate issues, related discourse is absorbing all other issues.

**Q: What is the core argument of global executives criticizing trade policies?**
A: They are concerned about the fragmentation of technology. The logic is that if countries restrict the export of components or prohibit data transfers for security reasons, the speed of development will slow down, ultimately hindering global economic growth.

**Q: How does this trend affect developers or users?**
A: As regulatory barriers rise, the monopoly of a few companies that can afford to comply may intensify. Conversely, if international standard norms are established, developers will gain a foundation for developing safe services that can be used worldwide.

## Conclusion
The shift in the main agenda of the Davos Forum signifies that the axis of power has moved. AI has now moved beyond the realm of technology to become the language of trade, diplomacy, and survival. As corporations have taken center stage in policy-making, the intentions hidden behind the slogans of progress should be closely examined.

The point to watch moving forward is how the discussions that erupted in Davos will be recorded in actual national laws and trade agreements. Whether technology becomes a tool for solving humanity's challenges or a source of new conflict depends on the outcome of the global regulatory discussions that have just begun.
