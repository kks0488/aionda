Tech demos always promise a rosy future. However, the reality of production environments is stark. Achieving full Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) remains an unattainable goal within the next decade.

## The Massive Barrier of Reliability
LLMs are probabilistic tools that predict the next token. In software engineering, 99% accuracy is synonymous with "failure." The issue of 'hallucination' is a structural flaw that remains unresolved. Core infrastructure cannot be built upon non-deterministic systems.

## Limitations of Physical Resources
Computing power requirements are increasing exponentially. Current power grids and data centers cannot keep pace with this trajectory. GPU supply-demand imbalances and exorbitant costs hinder universal adoption. The physical constraints of hardware are outpacing the illusions of software.

## Organizational and Institutional Inertia
Human systems change more slowly than technology. Discussions regarding liability and legal regulations have only just begun. Completely replacing legacy systems takes decades. Technological innovation cannot take root in the field without social consensus.

## Counterargument: The Potential of Scaling Laws
Certainly, Scaling Laws remain valid. Increasing computational input may lead to unforeseen leaps in intelligence. However, an improvement in intelligence does not inherently equate to the full autonomy of a system.

## Conclusion: Prepare for the Era of Augmentation
We must focus on "augmentation" rather than "replacement." Ten years from now, humans will still be at the center of decision-making. We must learn to treat Artificial Intelligence as a capable tool rather than an autonomous agent.
