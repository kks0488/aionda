# The Ripple Effects of China's LGFV Crisis: Cascading Shocks Towards the Korean Asset Market

The debt crisis of China's Local Government Financing Vehicles (LGFVs) transcends being merely a domestic Chinese issue and poses a tangible risk of spillover to the Korean economy. Particularly, if the concentration of Chinese capital in the domestic asset market intertwines with the historical vulnerability of the Korean won's value revealed in past crises, it could lead to a double burden of stagflation and currency instability. This article analyzes this chain of potential shocks based on verified data and presents a practical framework for defending personal assets.

## Current Status: Investigated Facts and Data

Data from the Financial Supervisory Service reveals the deep involvement of Chinese capital in the Korean real estate market. As of the first half of 2023, the outstanding balance of housing mortgage loans to Chinese nationals at the four major commercial banks reached approximately KRW 1.3338 trillion, accounting for 57.9% of all loans to foreigners. This figure is on an increasing trend. According to consolidated statistics from the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport and the Bank of Korea, by the end of 2024, Chinese nationals owned 56,301 housing units in Korea, representing 56% of all housing owned by foreigners and marking a record high. The scale of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) from China also surged by 94.4% year-on-year to USD 12.42 billion as of 2024, with real estate being a primary investment destination.

History shows how vulnerable the won's value can be during crises. During the 1997 foreign exchange crisis, the KRW/USD exchange rate soared from around 840 won at the beginning of the year to 1,964.80 won on December 24th, recording a fluctuation rate of approximately 133%. During the 2008 financial crisis, it rose from around 936 won at the end of 2007 to 1,570.30 won in March 2009, an increase of about 67.7%. In 1997, despite a downward trend in international gold prices, domestic gold prices surged due to the sharp depreciation of the won. In 2008, a combination of safe-haven demand and the rising exchange rate drove domestic gold prices to rise over 60% from early 2008 levels to their annual peak.

## Analysis: Implications and Impact

This data foreshadows two significant cascading shock scenarios. First, if the Chinese LGFV crisis intensifies, leading to a domestic capital crunch or further decline in the real estate market, it could trigger a rapid outflow of Chinese capital invested in Korean real estate. This could directly translate into downward pressure on domestic real estate prices. Second, if a crisis in China triggers a 'China Run,' deepening yuan depreciation and capital flight, the won, as an emerging market currency, would also face cascading devaluation pressure.

Historical patterns suggest that during such currency crises, demand for the US dollar surges, and won-denominated gold prices can skyrocket regardless of international gold price movements. This risks accelerating import prices, creating a stagflationary environment where economic stagnation coexists with inflation. The combination of real estate market growth reliant on Chinese capital and the structural vulnerability of the won opens a pathway for external shocks to simultaneously disrupt domestic prices and asset values.

## Practical Application: Methods Readers Can Utilize

Strategies for defending assets during a crisis should be structured in layers rather than relying on a single solution. To hedge against currency crisis risk, holding a portion of assets in the key currency, the US dollar, is a fundamental method to hedge against capital losses arising from exchange rate volatility. However, holding only US dollars may not fully offset domestic inflation risk.

Gold, a physical asset, has proven to be an effective hedge during stagflationary periods. Notably, domestic gold prices in Korea can provide returns exceeding international gold price gains when the won depreciates. Allocating a portion of a portfolio to gold can be a practical defensive measure to preserve asset value against the dual pressures of currency depreciation and inflation. The key is to combine holdings of key currencies like the US dollar with physical assets like gold to diversify risks from financial market uncertainty and loss of purchasing power.

## FAQ

**Q: Can the Chinese LGFV crisis directly impact the Korean economy?**
A: The indirect channel through capital outflow is more likely than a direct export channel. Given the concentration of Chinese capital in Korea, particularly in the real estate market, a sudden withdrawal of this capital could shock the domestic asset market and financial system.

**Q: Do gold prices always rise during a crisis?**
A: International gold prices can move differently depending on the situation. However, historically, when the won's value plummeted, won-denominated domestic gold prices showed a pattern of rising regardless of international gold price movements. This is due to the currency hedge effect.

**Q: What is the most practical way for individuals to hold US dollars?**
A: One can open a foreign currency deposit account or access US dollar-denominated ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) available for purchase domestically. It's important to adopt a long-term, diversified approach considering exchange fees and exchange rate fluctuation risks.

## Conclusion

The risks from China's LGFV crisis can transcend geographical distance to threaten Korea's asset market and currency stability. Verified data shows that the concentration of Chinese capital in domestic real estate and the historical vulnerability of the won could become key pathways for crisis transmission. Individuals should examine their portfolios for exposure to such cascading shocks and proactively build a multi-layered defense strategy combining key currencies and physical assets. In times of increasing uncertainty, responding based on verified historical patterns and facts, not speculation, is the first step to protecting one's assets.
