## TL;DR
- This diversification builds independent infrastructure and reduces reliance on specific cloud providers.
- Organizations should evaluate technical strategies to prepare for shifts in independent infrastructure services.

Example: Imagine a team managing a fleet of delivery vehicles across cities. An artificial intelligence system calculates efficient paths while managing the underlying data center workloads. It simultaneously coordinates digital auction processes for local business promotions along those routes. This integration aims to lower operational costs while creating new ways for intelligence providers to generate income.

An economic system combining the value of computing resources and intelligence is currently emerging. This represents a process of building an ecosystem including infrastructure, commerce, and advertising. It moves beyond the scope of simple chatbot services. 

OpenAI is pursuing a strategy that includes advertising, commerce, and computing resources. This approach expands beyond a focus on subscriptions and APIs. The design links AI performance improvements to revenue diversification. 

The company is solidifying its position as an independent infrastructure architect. This occurs while maintaining its partnership with Microsoft. 

## Current Status


## Analysis
OpenAI is evolving into a partner with its own competitive edge. It is diversifying its supply chain through cooperation with Oracle. The development of custom chips also supports this diversification. This strategy can secure resource scalability and reduce external risks. It also assists in managing long-term profitability. 


This process may lead to discussions regarding user experience or data privacy. Competition with existing search advertising leaders is likely. 

## Practical Application
Corporations should view OpenAI as an ecosystem providing both infrastructure and platforms. The commercialization of computing resources may change future cloud cost structures.

**Checklist for Today:**
- Evaluate current infrastructure to ensure the organization can move between different providers if necessary.
- Create a transition plan for computational costs considering the 2026 timeline for self-designed chip efficiency.
- Develop internal policies regarding brand interactions with future recommendation and advertising algorithms.

## FAQ
**Q: Will user experience decline if OpenAI starts an advertising business?**
A: Advertisements could be introduced without interfering with the conversation flow. Maintaining a balance between ad frequency and objectivity will be important.

**Q: How is the relationship with Microsoft changing?**
A: The strategic partnership remains in place. Competitive elements are emerging as OpenAI diversifies its infrastructure.

**Q: Can general enterprises directly purchase OpenAI's computing resources?**
A: No specific pricing or schedules for these services have been confirmed. The current focus is on building infrastructure for internal services.

## Conclusion
OpenAI intends to own the pipelines where intelligence flows. The 2025 revenue and computing capacity figures support this vision. Efficiency of self-designed chips in 2026 will be an important metric. The impact of the 10 GW capacity planned for 2029 should be monitored. 

Readers should track strategies linking intelligence value to infrastructure value. Maintaining a flexible technology stack is advisable.
