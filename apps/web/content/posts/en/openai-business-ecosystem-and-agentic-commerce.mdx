Intelligence is evolving beyond providing simple answers to becoming an engine for the real economy that directly opens users' wallets. OpenAI, led by Sam Altman, is breaking out of the narrow framework of chatbots to expand its battlefield into a vast business ecosystem encompassing advertising, commerce, and its own computing infrastructure. This move is more than just a diversification of revenue streams; it is a declaration of intent for artificial intelligence to completely dominate human decision-making and purchasing processes.

## From the Monetization of Intelligence to the Economization of Intelligence

Starting in January 2026, OpenAI began displaying contextually tailored advertisements at the bottom of conversation windows for free users in the United States and subscribers of the new 'Go' plan ($8/month). This represents a strategic shift from a model solely dependent on subscription fees to securing a mass-market revenue source to cover high infrastructure operating costs. While the 'Go' plan offers a more affordable price point than existing premium plans, users must accept commercial messages integrated into their AI interactions in exchange.

It does not stop at simply showing ads. Through the 'Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP)' and 'Instant Checkout' features, OpenAI is building a direct transaction ecosystem where AI agents handle the entire process from product search to payment. When a user says, "Buy me a sturdy backpack suitable for tomorrow's trip," the AI agent 'Operator' finds the optimal product through browsing and completes the order using the Stripe payment network.

Simultaneously, OpenAI has declared hardware independence. Moving away from its total past reliance on Microsoft Azure, it is developing its own custom AI chips in partnership with Broadcom and has diversified its infrastructure partnerships with Oracle and AWS. The 'Stargate' project with Microsoft has also seen its cloud contract terms modified, securing flexibility for the acquisition of computing assets valued at $500 billion. OpenAI has now entered the path of vertical integration, controlling everything from software to physical servers and chipsets.

## Neutrality of Answers vs. The Logic of Capital

These moves by OpenAI inevitably trigger a 'crisis of trust.' While the company emphasizes the principle of 'Answer Independence'—stating that advertisements do not directly intervene in answer generation algorithms—concerns persist that the interests of advertisers will subtly influence the tone of answers or recommendation rankings due to the nature of capitalism.

This issue becomes particularly complex in the era of 'Agentic Commerce,' where agents exercise purchasing power. When an AI recommends a specific brand's product and induces payment, it is difficult to discern whether it is truly the best choice for the user or a partner's offer providing higher commissions to OpenAI. In the era of search advertising, users at least had the opportunity to judge by clicking links themselves; however, in an environment where agents act on behalf of the user for all processes, the window for critical thinking narrows.

Expanding into the computing business is also a double-edged sword. While developing custom chips and diversifying infrastructure is advantageous for cost reduction and securing independence, it creates a potential competitive relationship with existing Cloud Service Providers (CSPs), including its long-time ally Microsoft. If OpenAI emerges as an independent computing service provider beyond being a mere partner, the cooperative relationships between tech giants could turn into a ruthless competition for survival at any moment.

## How to Survive in the AI Agent Economy

Business leaders and developers must now respond to 'transactional interfaces' rather than just 'conversational interfaces.' Beyond simply optimizing websites for search engines, it is time to consider how to integrate company product information into OpenAI's ACP protocol. The top priority is to provide structured data that AI agents can easily read and to refine payment APIs so that tools like 'Operator' can trigger immediate transactions.

General users must confront what they are paying for intelligence. Behind the low $8 monthly subscription fee or free services lies a structure where user conversation data and purchasing habits are analyzed for advertisers. A habit of constantly questioning whether the recommendations made by an AI assistant are neutral or mixed with commercial bias is necessary.

## FAQ

**Q: If I use an ad-supported model, will my conversation content be sent directly to advertisers?**
A: OpenAI maintains the principle that ads are displayed contextually and do not affect the generation of answers itself. However, the possibility remains that the context of conversations may be utilized in an anonymized form for ad targeting, and continuous monitoring regarding the specific scope of data sharing is required.

**Q: Is it safe to give payment authority to the AI agent 'Operator'?**
A: OpenAI is establishing secure payment standards through its partnership with Stripe. However, legal and technical safeguards—such as liability in cases where the agent misunderstands the user's intent to purchase the wrong product or the refund process—are still in the supplementary stages. It is recommended to use settings that require a final approval step for high-value payments.

**Q: How will the relationship with Microsoft change in the future?**
A: The relationship between the two companies is being redefined from an exclusive supply relationship to a strategic partnership. OpenAI is diversifying its computing resources by utilizing Oracle, AWS, and others in addition to Azure, which can be interpreted from Microsoft's perspective as both losing a powerful customer and a signal of intensifying market competition. However, large-scale collaborations such as the 'Stargate' project are expected to be maintained.

## Conclusion

OpenAI has now transformed from a company that sells intelligence into a company that builds the economic highway through which intelligence flows. The scaling strategy of bundling advertising, commerce, and infrastructure into one will be a critical test for proving the profitability of the AI industry. The world is watching OpenAI's next conversation window to see if it can successfully transplant the logic of massive capital without betraying user trust.
