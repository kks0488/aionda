OpenAI unveiled "o1," a new artificial intelligence model with enhanced logical reasoning capabilities, on September 12. This model is designed to solve complex challenges in science, mathematics, and programming. Unlike previous models, it adopts a mechanism to review its own thought process before generating a response.

## Why It Matters
o1 recorded an 83% accuracy rate on the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) qualifying exam, a significant leap from the 13% achieved by its predecessor, GPT-4o. According to the [OpenAI official announcement](https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/), the model demonstrates PhD-level performance in natural sciences such as physics and chemistry.

Moving beyond simple text generation, the model self-verifies its logical steps. The AI attempts various approaches and corrects its own errors to reach the correct solution. This capability is expected to provide practical assistance in fields requiring high-precision reasoning, such as drug discovery and advanced software architecture.

## Background
Existing Large Language Models (LLMs) have primarily relied on statistical probabilities between words. While this approach is effective for intuitive responses, it has shown limitations in handling complex logical structures. To overcome this, researchers have focused on the "Chain of Thought" (CoT) technique.

o1 automates this reasoning process through reinforcement learning. During its training phase, the model was rewarded for selecting more efficient cognitive paths. The project garnered significant industry attention during its development under the codename "Strawberry."

## Outlook
Currently, the o1-preview version is available to ChatGPT paid users on a limited basis. Because the reasoning process requires significant computation, response speeds are slower than those of previous models. However, industry experts evaluate this model as a critical milestone in the evolution toward autonomous, problem-solving AI.
