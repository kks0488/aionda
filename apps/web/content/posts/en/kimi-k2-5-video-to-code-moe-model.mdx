## TL;DR
- Moonshot AI Kimi K2.5 converts video input into code.
- The model scored 76.8% on SWE-bench and 86.6% on VideoMMMU.
- It uses a Mixture-of-Experts architecture with 1.04 trillion parameters.

Example: A person records a screen showing a button that changes color. The AI watches the motion and writes code. Visual materials replace long text descriptions for the user.

## Current Status: The Arrival of Video-Reading Coding Models
Kimi K2.5 is a multimodal model from Moonshot AI.
It was pre-trained on 15 trillion text and visual tokens.
The model identifies visual flows in video files.
It can reconstruct these flows into executable code.
It handles temporal elements like scroll animations.
The model also processes dynamic layout changes.
Kimi K2.5 uses a Mixture-of-Experts structure.
The total parameters count is 1.04 trillion.
It activates only 32 billion parameters per token.
This design helps increase computational efficiency.
The model provides a 256K context window.
This window supports high-resolution images and videos.
Users can access the model through the NVIDIA NIM API.
It showed a 76.8% success rate on SWE-bench Verified.
It also recorded 86.6% on VideoMMMU.
These results suggest strong visual and coding integration.

## Analysis: The Evolution of 'Vibe Coding' and Technical Barriers
Kimi K2.5 expands the scope of vibe coding.
Users can provide visual guidelines through video.
This process can reduce communication errors.
Productivity might improve when drafting frontend code.
Video data requires more computing resources than text.
Moonshot AI uses a spatial-temporal pooling technique.
This technology optimizes token consumption for the model.
It compresses data before processing visual features.
Users should consider inference costs for large inputs.
Processing speed can vary with large-scale video.
Media outlets like ZDNet suggest further verification.
Practical value in business environments remains uncertain.
Data on backend logic compliance is currently limited.
Information on specific library specifications is also lacking.
Sampling standards for video have not been disclosed.
These factors represent technical uncertainties for users.

## Practical Application
**Checklist for Today:**
- Record a short video of a web interaction or animation.
- Ask Kimi K2.5 to convert the visual flow into code.
- Review the library dependencies in the resulting output.

## FAQ
**Q: How is the token load managed during video input?**
A: The model uses a spatial-temporal pooling technique.
This compresses visual information before processing.
The MoE structure also increases efficiency.
It activates only the necessary parameters for data.

**Q: How does it differ from existing image-based models?**
A: Static images show only a result.
Video shows the entire process over time.
The model can reproduce dynamic interactions.
It handles scrolling and transition animations.

**Q: Can it generate code by specifying a particular UI framework?**
A: This is possible within the basic model capabilities.
Specific accuracy figures for each framework are unavailable.
Users should specify the tech stack in their prompts.

## Conclusion
Kimi K2.5 changes how developers explain their goals.
Video-based capabilities can lower entry barriers.
They can shorten the time to create visual effects.
Technical efficiency in work environments needs more validation.
Developers should consider how to show results to AI.
Knowing how to write code remains important.
