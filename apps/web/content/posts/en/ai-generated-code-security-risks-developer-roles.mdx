## TL;DR
- This shift changes the developer role from writing code to reviewing output.
- Teams should implement scanning tools and verification protocols for all AI suggestions.

Example: A developer asks an assistant to build a user login feature. The tool provides ready code for the request. The output lacks proper input validation for security. This omission allows external attacks on the system logic.

## Current Status
AI tools speed up development but introduce significant security concerns. Studies found security flaws in code suggestions at rates between 39.33% and 40.73%. Accepting these suggestions without review can create dangerous attack vectors.

Common vulnerabilities include Cross-Site Scripting, SQL Injection, OS Command Injection, and Path Traversal. One report indicates a security failure rate of approximately 40% in AI-generated code samples. Risk levels change based on the language and the composition of training data.

## Analysis
AI-generated code often lacks a security context for specific business logic. These tools replicate patterns from large datasets without understanding long-term system architecture. Technical debt can increase through poor readability or redundant logic.

Developers should transition into roles as architects and reviewers. They should select the best drafts and correct identified flaws. This shift presents challenges for junior developers learning basic skills. Over-reliance on tools can hinder the development of necessary debugging intuition.

Hiring criteria may focus more on security and system design. Differentiating talent will rely on the ability to verify code reliability. Teams should prioritize engineering quality over simple output speed.

## Practical Application
Organizations should create management processes for using AI tools. Using code without scrutiny can lead to serious security incidents.

**Checklist for Today:**
- Use static analysis tools to check for vulnerabilities in AI snippets.
- Mark AI-generated code during reviews to verify style and readability.
- Analyze the security and performance gaps between AI and manual code.

## FAQ
**Q: Can improved AI models resolve these security issues?**
A: Models can include patches, but security requires specific business context. AI may not fully grasp data flow and service requirements. Human verification remains essential for final code security.

**Q: Do some programming languages have more vulnerabilities?**

**Q: How can teams prevent technical debt from AI code?**
A: Use clear prompts that define the code intent. Break generated code into small units for rigorous testing. Broad test coverage can help detect flaws in AI suggestions.

## Conclusion
AI can increase productivity but requires significant safeguards. A vulnerability rate near 40% suggests AI should remain an assistant. Success in development will belong to architects who identify errors. Focus on the fundamentals of security value and engineering maintainability for every line of code.
