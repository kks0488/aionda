# Jen Easterly’s New Battlefield: From CISA Director to the Helm of RSA Conference

## TL;DR
- Former CISA Director Jen Easterly now leads the RSA Conference.
- she may bring public sector security principles to private industry platforms.
- The conference agenda might focus on artificial intelligence and geopolitical risks.

Example: A strategist who once surveyed national maps in a dim room now prepares for a new stage. Her next destination is the platform where global engineers gather to discuss future threats. A perspective once focused on national safety now shifts toward the survival strategies of private enterprises.

Cybersecurity involves technical issues and competition between nations. Artificial Intelligence adds to these uncertainties. Jen Easterly led the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. Her appointment as RSA Conference head suggests an industry shift. Public sector experience now integrates with a private platform. Policy and technology may converge in this new phase.

## Current Status
Easterly leads the RSA Conference during a technological transition. She transitions her public security experience to a private sector platform. The RSA Conference acts as a venue where security professionals discuss policies and standards. 

This change offers a chance to reflect "Secure by Design" philosophies in products. Easterly might define the organization's direction using public insights. Internal discussions will likely finalize start dates and operational plans. 

Her leadership may focus on linking technical competition to national security. The conference could evolve into an organization that sets global agendas. This move connects technical competition with strategic discussions.

## Analysis
Easterly's move to the conference suggests a shift toward strategic resilience. She previously requested security accountability from corporations. This stance could influence the future RSA agenda. Technology security might merge more closely with policy and defense strategies. 

However, the leadership transition presents certain challenges. Public sector standards can be difficult to apply to commercial environments. A balance between sponsors and technical autonomy is often necessary. Voluntary corporate participation might decrease if the conference mirrors government policy too closely. 

Governance for AI security remains a significant point of interest. AI acts as both a security tool and a threat. Demands for supply chain protection measures are also likely to increase.

## Practical Application
Security leaders should monitor policy changes from this leadership transition. RSA Conference agendas often serve as benchmarks for product standards. 

**Checklist for Today:**
- Review "Secure by Design" guidelines potentially presented at the 2026 RSA Conference.
- Evaluate if internal security policies align with public sector requirements.
- Update response procedures for security incidents involving artificial intelligence and geopolitical risks.

## FAQ
**Q: Will the nature of the RSA Conference change with Jen Easterly’s appointment?**
A: The conference will likely keep its technology focus while increasing policy discussions. It may attempt to integrate commercial and public interest goals.

**Q: How will this leadership change affect the field of AI security?**
A: AI Risk Management Frameworks could become major topics at the conference. Public-private cooperation for managing model vulnerabilities might strengthen.

**Q: What should general corporate security managers prepare for?**
A: Managers should evaluate if products align with public sector standards. They can also consider geopolitical risks during the selection process.

## Conclusion
Jen Easterly’s appointment suggests that security is now a core national strategy. She will likely try to connect the industry into a defense framework. Her leadership builds on trust established during her time at CISA. The conference might become a hub for designing digital safety.
