# AI Hallucination: The Inherent Limitation of the Technology and Practical Mitigation Strategies

AI hallucination, where AI confidently generates non-factual content, is not merely a bug. It is a fundamental limitation stemming from the probabilistic generation architecture of large language models and biases in training data. While user frustration shows that this technical flaw directly impacts service reliability and real-world adoption, its effects can be significantly mitigated through verification mechanisms and wise usage strategies.

## Current Status: Investigated Facts and Data

According to research from OpenAI and Google, technologies like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) show meaningful effectiveness in reducing hallucinations. Specifically, RAG can reduce hallucination rates by approximately 30% or more compared to conventional LLMs. Google Vertex AI's research on grounded generation lowered hallucination rates from around 40% to 0-10%, while another study utilizing OpenAI models improved factual accuracy by 21.2% and reduced hallucinations by about 26.8%. However, these figures heavily depend on task complexity and the quality of reference data; there is no universal number applicable to all situations.

In academia, methods for measuring hallucinations are also evolving. Papers from NeurIPS and ACM propose quantitative metrics such as PHR (Posterior Hallucination Rate) using Bayesian posterior probability or MaHR (Macro Hallucination Rate) indicating the proportion of hallucinations within a set of responses. According to recent benchmarks, GPT 5.2 recorded a hallucination rate of about 45.15% among non-refused responses. In contrast, Llama-3.1-8B achieved a lower hallucination rate of about 48.37% through a high refusal-to-answer rate (83.09%), confirming that models make trade-offs between performance and safety.

## Analysis: Meaning and Impact

Hallucinations directly undermine user trust. Approximately 60% of tech leaders cite it as their top concern for AI adoption, and apps where hallucinations are reported tend to show a clear decline in user sentiment scores in reviews. Interestingly, however, this loss of trust does not always hinder service usage. A study targeting Korean users in their 20s and 30s showed that the majority continued to use the service even while being aware of hallucinations. While trust significantly impacted satisfaction when used for information retrieval, its influence was relatively minor when used as a creative aid.

This suggests that the perspective on the hallucination problem should not be dichotomous. The key challenge is designing a balance between accuracy and usefulness, as demonstrated by approaches like that of Llama-3.1-8B, which refuses to answer what it doesn't know rather than attempting to answer all questions. Users are already evaluating and accepting AI outputs differently depending on their purpose.

## Practical Application: Methods Readers Can Use

To practically utilize AI while being aware of these limitations, a strategy is needed. First, AI should be positioned not as a sole source of knowledge, but as an idea generator or drafting tool. Especially for tasks where facts are critical, it is effective to choose tools that support evidence-based generation methods like RAG. This enhances response accuracy by referencing external knowledge bases.

Second, users must always cultivate the habit of critically verifying AI outputs. Important facts, figures, and quotations must be cross-checked against credible primary sources. Even if an AI's response is delivered in a very confident tone, remembering that this does not guarantee accuracy is the starting point for wise collaboration.

## FAQ

**Q: Can all AI hallucinations be completely eliminated?**
A: Given the current generative AI architecture, fundamentally reducing hallucinations to 0% faces technical limitations. The focus of research and technological advancement is more on systematically lowering hallucination rates and ensuring models honestly indicate uncertainty.

**Q: In what types of tasks are hallucinations most dangerous?**
A: Hallucinations pose the greatest risk in fields where accurate facts are directly linked to life, property, or critical decisions, such as medical diagnosis, legal advice, financial counsel, and historical fact narration. In contrast, for tasks like brainstorming or creative writing assistance, they may be considered an acceptable level of risk.

**Q: Is there a way for general users to directly check a model's hallucination rate?**
A: It is difficult for general users to directly measure quantitative hallucination rates. Instead, they can refer to technical blogs or research summaries discussing how specific models performed in benchmark tests. A more practical method is to ask simple fact-verification questions within one's field to multiple models and compare the responses.

## Conclusion

AI hallucination is not a magical bug that will disappear, but an inherent property of the technology that we must manage. Research shows improvements of around 30% with technologies like RAG, and user studies reveal a flexible acceptance attitude based on purpose. Therefore, our stance should not be to expect perfect hallucination-free performance, but to accurately understand the technology's limits, make human verification an essential process for important decisions, and position AI as a realistic collaborator in the right place.
