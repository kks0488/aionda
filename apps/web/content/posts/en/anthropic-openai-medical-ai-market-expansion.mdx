The speed at which general-purpose artificial intelligence is penetrating the healthcare field—where patient lives are at stake—is exceeding expectations. Chatbots that were writing poetry and code just yesterday are now donning the white coats of "specialists," analyzing clinical records and decoding genetic data. As two giants of the AI industry, OpenAI and Anthropic, simultaneously cross the threshold of the massive vertical healthcare market, the AI healthcare sector is shifting from simple auxiliary tools toward a competition for core infrastructure.

### AI Giants Learning the Language of Medicine

Anthropic’s recently unveiled healthcare-specific brand, ‘Claude for Health,’ clearly demonstrates the technical requirements for evolving a general-purpose AI model into a specialized domain. Historically, the primary reason the medical community hesitated to adopt generative AI was security and regulation. To address this directly, Anthropic has made HIPAA compliance and the signing of Business Associate Agreements (BAA) a standard specification.

Particularly noteworthy is the enforcement of a ‘Zero-retention’ policy. Claude for Health technically blocks the path through which input medical data could be used for model training. Furthermore, it features a dedicated API optimized for HL7 FHIR R4, the international standard for health information exchange. This ensures interoperability, allowing the AI to immediately understand and process fragmented data such as diagnosis codes (ICD-10) or health insurance claim data (CMS).

Meanwhile, OpenAI is accelerating the internalization of technology through startup acquisitions. OpenAI acquired ‘Torch,’ a health-tech company, for an amount estimated between $60 million and $100 million. Torch is the core of ‘Unified Medical Memory’ technology, which integrates scattered personal health information. This technology, which binds real-time data from wearables, past medical records, and lab results into a single context, is expected to be the engine for the forthcoming ‘ChatGPT Health.’ It lays the foundation for AI to evolve beyond simply answering questions into a personalized primary care physician that remembers and advises on a patient’s entire medical lifecycle.

### Movement of Giant Capital Toward an $11.6 Billion Market by 2035

Behind these vertical expansion strategies lies astronomical capital. The healthcare AI market based on voice and neural interfaces is expected to grow steeply at an average annual rate of 37.85%, from approximately $650.65 million in 2026 to approximately $11.69 billion by 2035.

The potential of this market stems from interface innovation. The $252 million seed investment in Merge Labs, led by OpenAI, targets non-invasive Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) technology, moving beyond simple voice assistants. This prepares for a future where patients can communicate with AI and receive medical services through brainwaves or neural signals even when they cannot speak or move.

However, the picture has cracks. Some analyses suggest it could take decades for Merge Labs' non-invasive interface technology to reach the actual consumer market. Additionally, conflicting reports on the acquisition price of Torch ($60 million to $100 million) suggest opacity behind the rapidly growing market. Doubts also remain in the field regarding whether technically perfect ‘Zero-retention’ can operate flawlessly in actual cloud environments without configuration errors by practitioners.

### Reshaping Medical Workflows

Now, healthcare institutions and developers must look beyond ‘which AI is smarter’ and consider ‘which interface integrates most safely into our systems.’ The emergence of Claude for Health provides an environment where developers no longer need to struggle with security configurations. By utilizing built-in medical data connectors, the speed of integration with existing Hospital Information Systems (HIS) can be dramatically increased.

From the patient’s perspective, services like ‘ChatGPT Health’ provide an integrated guide that understands their entire medical context. For example, the AI could simultaneously analyze an MRI taken yesterday and heart rate measured by a smartwatch this morning to suggest the optimal exercise intensity. This represents a process of vertical integration where fragmented medical services coalesce around AI, marking a turning point from hospital-centered medical systems to patient-centered personalized services.

### FAQ: Key Questions on Vertical Expansion in Healthcare AI

**Q1: Is data security truly safe when using Claude for Health?**
A: Anthropic publicly states that through its ‘Zero-retention’ policy, input data is never used for model training. It also provides legal and technical safeguards through HIPAA compliance and BAA agreements. However, since the actual operational security level may vary depending on the detailed security guidelines of each cloud provider (AWS, GCP, etc.), internal security policy reviews must be conducted in parallel.

**Q2: When will technology from OpenAI’s acquisition of Torch be available to general users?**
A: Currently, Torch’s ‘Unified Medical Memory’ technology is being integrated into OpenAI’s internal infrastructure. While a specific deployment date has not been disclosed, the industry expects it to be applied sequentially in the form of ‘ChatGPT Health’ services providing personalized advice.

**Q3: Will voice AI interfaces completely replace existing medical staff?**
A: It is closer to ‘liberation’ than replacement. Voice AI acts as an assistant that reduces the time doctors spend entering charts and monitors patient status in real-time. The core of this market, expected to grow to $11.6 billion by 2035, is a workflow innovation that allows AI to take over simple repetitive tasks while human doctors focus on final judgments and emotional connection with patients.

### Conclusion: Evolution from Platforms to Specialized Infrastructure

The entry of AI labs into the medical market has only just begun. The ‘general intelligence’ provided by general-purpose AI is now transforming into ‘specialized infrastructure’ equipped with the specific regulations and standards of the medical field. While it remains to be seen whether OpenAI’s data integration capabilities or Anthropic’s regulatory compliance strategy will prevail, one thing is certain: we have entered an era where the quality of medical services is determined by how deeply AI is integrated into the system. The moment BCI technologies like Merge Labs enter the commercialization stage will mark the completion of true vertical integration in healthcare AI.
