  “AI-sounding” content is mainly a QA failure: missing editing, verification,
  and accountability. Measure claims, cite sources, and document review.

At 09:00, an editor-in-chief skims a draft and stops at one line.  
The sentence looks polished.  
The tone sounds uniform and overly certain.  
There are no sources.  
There are no signs of fact-checking.  
Readers may read this as “AI-ish” and leave.

## TL;DR

- This describes QA for AI-assisted writing, beyond style fixes and detector use.  
- It matters because claim-level errors and weak evidence can erode credibility.  
- Next, split drafts into claims, attach sources, and log verification work.

Example: A reader sees smooth paragraphs and confident wording. The piece still feels thin and hard to trust. The reader asks for sources, and none appear.

In environments where generative AI helps write content, advantage may come from **quality assurance (QA)**.  
Prompt tweaking may not remove the underlying risks.  
Style homogenization, weak authenticity, and hallucinations can appear together.  
They can reduce trust.  
A “detector” alone may not solve this.  
A repeatable operating design can help.  
It can integrate editing, verification, and accountability.

## TL;DR

- **What changed / what is the core issue?** “AI-ishness” is not only a style issue.  
  Missing verification, editing, and accountability systems can amplify it.
- **Why does it matter?** Credibility depends on how claims are measured and verified.  
  Some documentation uses metrics like claim error rate and major-error share.
- **What should readers do?** Detector outputs should not drive definitive judgments alone.  
  Split writing into claim-level units, attach sources, and document a QA pipeline.

## Current state

AI writing QA often starts by separating two problem types.  
First are **style and stance issues**.  
These can make readers feel the writing “shows.”  
Second are **factual errors or missing evidence**.  
These can create operational risk.  
They can appear together.  
The response can differ.  
Style can improve through editing.  
Factuality can degrade without verification.

Some evaluation frameworks treat hallucinations as errors in factual claims.  
They focus on **claims**, not just overall impressions.  
An OpenAI system card describes two factuality metrics.  
One is **hallucination rate**, defined as a fraction of claims with errors.  
Another is the **fraction of responses** with at least one major erroneous claim.  
This approach separates minor from major errors.  
It does not only label a document “mostly correct.”

“AI detectors” can seem helpful.  
Some findings suggest caution.  
Performance varies by system.  
Some generators can fool many detectors in some conditions.  
Some detectors can distinguish outputs from many generators in some conditions.  
Other research reports false positives for human text polished with AI.  
*Almost AI, Almost Human* reports an APT‑Eval dataset with about **14.7K** (≈15K) samples.  
It reports frequent misclassification for minimally polished text.

## Analysis

“AI-ishness” can reflect repetitive patterns.  
Missing editing can contribute to those patterns.  
With the same tool, a style guide can support voice.  
Copyediting rules can also help.  
If a team focuses only on prompting skill, outcomes may converge.  
Drafts may stay source-free.  
Certainty may remain high.  
Readers may interpret that as machine-like writing.

Another misconception is relying on detectors as a filter.  
NIST and other studies show detectors can vary by conditions.  
They can produce false positives and false negatives.  
Polishing workflows can worsen this.  
They can lead detectors to mistake human writing for AI.  
A different standard can help.  
It can shift from guessing tool use to building evidence-based content.

NIST AI RMF describes TEVV in the Measure function.  
TEVV expands to Testing, Evaluation, Verification, and Validation.  
It includes regular testing before deployment and during operations.  
It also includes reporting that includes uncertainty.  
It also mentions benchmark comparisons and formal documentation.  
Writing QA can adapt that structure.

## Practical implementation

A helpful step is converting a draft into a **list of claims**.  
Each claim should be verifiable.  
Attach to each claim supporting links or materials.  
Also record the verifier.  
Also record a status, like verified, on hold, or removed.  
Templates can support this workflow.  
This often helps more than prompt tuning.  
Without it, the same problems can recur, even if the model changes.

## Practical Application

The workflow can treat drafts as claim bundles.  
It can treat edits as verification work.  
It can also keep an audit trail for decisions.

**Checklist for Today:**
- Extract factual claims as items before making sentence-level edits.  
- Attach evidence and a verification status to each claim in a shared log.  
- Re-measure key claims regularly and record reviewer and uncertainty notes.

## FAQ

**Q1. Can prompts eliminate “AI-ishness”?**  
A. Prompts can help reduce it.  
They may not address everything.  
Style homogenization can also come from missing style guides.  
It can also come from missing editing rules.  
It can also come from missing verification.  
Tone can be handled with editing.  
Trust can be supported with verification.

**Q2. If we use an AI detector, does the trust problem go away?**  
A. Risk can increase if decisions rely on one detector output.  
NIST reports large performance variance across systems.  
Some generators can fool many detectors under some conditions.  
Research also suggests polished human writing can be misclassified.  
Detection can be a reference signal.  
Trust can rely on multiple evidence types.  
Examples include sources, authorship history, and SME review.

**Q3. How should factuality be measured?**  
A. Some documents suggest claim-error-based measurement.  
The system card mentions dual metrics.  
It mentions hallucination rate among factual claims.  
It also mentions a response-level major-error fraction.  
Content QA can mirror this.  
Split drafts into claims.  
Verify them.  
Log results.

## Conclusion

In AI writing, quality can align with being wrong less.  
It may align less with sounding plausible.  
Detector debates may not resolve trust issues.  
Trust can be supported by claim-based verification.  
A documented editorial process can also support it.  
The next decision is operational.  
It is whether AI adoption stays tool-focused.  
Or it can become a TEVV-style operating system.
