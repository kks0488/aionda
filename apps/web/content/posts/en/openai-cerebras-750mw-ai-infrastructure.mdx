In an era where massive data centers built by connecting thousands of Nvidia GPUs were considered the definitive answer for artificial intelligence (AI), OpenAI has made a new strategic move. The era of waiting for the 'typing effect,' where text is output one character at a time, may soon come to an end. OpenAI has joined forces with chip startup Cerebras to build a 750MW (megawatt) ultra-high-speed AI computing infrastructure, targeting the speed limits of real-time AI services.

## Beyond Nvidia's Fortress: The Rebellion of a Single 'Wafer'

The core weapon OpenAI is adopting from Cerebras is the 'Wafer Scale Engine (WSE).' Unlike typical semiconductors, which are made by cutting a large silicon wafer into hundreds of small pieces, Cerebras uses an entire wafer as a single chip. Integrated onto this massive piece of silicon are 44GB of SRAM memory alongside the computational cores.

The biggest challenge for existing GPU-based systems has been the 'bottleneck.' While computation is fast, the pathways to retrieve data from memory (HBM) are narrow, preventing the chips from reaching their full performance potential. Cerebras' WSE widens this pathway by integrating memory directly into the chip. The results are proven by numbers: Cerebras' memory bandwidth is 21PB/s, which is approximately 7,000 times higher than existing GPUs.

These physical strengths translate directly into service quality. According to test results based on the Llama 3.1 (70B) model, the Cerebras infrastructure recorded inference speeds approximately 15 to 20 times faster than GPUs. It is capable of pouring out up to 3,000 tokens per second. This performance, which far exceeds human reading speed, becomes the foundation for the 'AI that answers as soon as it thinks' envisioned by OpenAI.

## 750MW Ambition: Shifting the Supply Chain Landscape

The 750MW power capacity secured by OpenAI holds significance beyond a simple number. This massive scale, approaching the output of a small-to-medium nuclear power plant, indicates the level of capital and commitment OpenAI is investing in hardware infrastructure.

This partnership also serves as a strategic exit for OpenAI to reduce its extreme dependency on Nvidia. Previously, the AI industry had to adjust service expansion plans according to Nvidia's supply schedules and pricing policies. By securing a powerful alternative in Cerebras, OpenAI can diversify its infrastructure supply chain and establish a proprietary computing environment specialized for low-latency inference workloads. This becomes a core asset that guarantees service stability and independence from the situation of a specific manufacturer.

Of course, there are not only rosy outlooks. Some express concerns about the financial pressure from the reported $10 billion contract and the high power consumption of Cerebras equipment. The massive single-chip architecture requires far more demanding engineering capabilities for heat management and power supply than traditional methods. Furthermore, it remains to be seen how smoothly Cerebras equipment can be integrated at the software level with OpenAI's upcoming models.

## The Dawn of the Real-time Multimodal Era

The changes felt by users will be dramatic. 750MW-class high-speed computing resources will be particularly powerful in 'multimodal' services such as voice conversation or real-time image generation. Currently, AI voice assistants experience subtle pauses after listening to and understanding a user's words before generating an answer. With Cerebras infrastructure applied, this latency will be drastically reduced, enabling seamless interaction as if talking to a real person.

Developers can now design complex agent-based services that were previously abandoned due to inference speed constraints. Even if an AI goes through multiple steps of reasoning, if the response speed is fast enough, users will not even perceive that the AI is processing vast amounts of data in the background. OpenAI plans to use this infrastructure expansion to stably provide near-real-time intelligent services to hundreds of millions of users worldwide.

## FAQ: Three Things You Might Be Curious About

**Q1: How much faster will ChatGPT answers specifically become once Cerebras infrastructure is introduced?**
A: Based on test cases for the Llama 3.1 (70B) model, inference speeds approximately 15 to 20 times faster than existing GPU environments can be expected. This means sentence-level answers will pour out the moment a user asks a question, and it will particularly eliminate waiting times in voice mode.

**Q2: Will Nvidia GPUs no longer be used due to this partnership?**
A: No. This partnership is focused on 'diversifying' the infrastructure. While Nvidia's general-purpose GPU clusters may still be efficient for large-scale model training, the strategy is to maximize efficiency in the 'inference' service domain, where real-time response is critical, by using Cerebras' specialized chips.

**Q3: How large is the 750MW power scale?**
A: It is a massive scale capable of supplying power to hundreds of thousands of households. This serves as an indicator that OpenAI is evolving beyond a simple software company into an energy and computing company that directly controls vast physical infrastructure.

## Conclusion: A World Where Speed is Intelligence

The meeting of OpenAI and Cerebras suggests that the central axis of AI technology is moving from 'model size' to 'real-time accessibility.' No matter how smart an AI is, its value as a tool decreases if the response is slow. If this massive experiment combining 750MW of power and the Wafer Scale Engine succeeds, we will finally enter the era of true 'real-time intelligence' where we can converse with AI without delay. Attention is now focused on the synergy this overwhelming hardware will create with OpenAI's next models.
