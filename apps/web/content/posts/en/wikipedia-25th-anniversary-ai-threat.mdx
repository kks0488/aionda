## TL;DR
- AI data scraping may harm the open knowledge-sharing model of Wikipedia.
- Fewer active editors and growing political interference challenge the repository.
- An imbalance in knowledge production threatens the sustainability of open-source resources.

Example: Individuals sit at library desks. They transcribe contents from thick encyclopedias. Outside the window, large machinery sucks up shelves of books. The machines transport them elsewhere. People who organize the books disappear. Information taken by machines becomes corporate services sold to the public.

Wikipedia reached its 25th anniversary. Concerns about survival run deeper than celebrations. Data collection by AI companies threatens the knowledge ecosystem. Voluntary contributors maintain this open repository. It faces challenges from technology and political pressure.

## Current Status
The online encyclopedia faces a complex crisis. Its open model has become a vulnerability. Tech companies use Wikipedia data to train models. The Wikimedia Foundation might not receive adequate compensation.

Internal momentum is also weakening. The number of voluntary editors is declining. AI-generated summaries occupy the top of search results. Users have fewer reasons to visit Wikipedia's main text. This trend might block new contributors.

Some groups pressure the neutral narratives. This attempts to undermine the objectivity of information. Public perception is also shifting. Some suggest the ideology of collective intelligence is failing. Audiences often ignore the verification of sources.

## Analysis
Data collection could cause the destruction of the knowledge commons. Wikipedia grew through open editing and reading. AI absorbs knowledge without contributing back. This results in data cannibalism. Knowledge production might stop. Then, the performance of AI models is likely to regress.

Political pressure and distrust accelerate structural collapse. Demands for information modification harm universal accessibility. Blocking access also damages the foundation of the site. If AI models learn biased information, that bias can spread. A crisis in repositories leads to a crisis of facts.

## Practical Application
Users and developers can take action to protect the ecosystem. If knowledge sources disappear, AI answers become hard to trust.

**Checklist for Today:**
- Verify information sources and cross-check Wikipedia entries for accuracy.
- Support platform operations by participating in donation programs.
- Monitor for inaccurate information or machine-generated text in entries.

## FAQ
**Q: Why is AI use of Wikipedia data problematic?**
A: Tech companies use the data for commercial profit. Proper compensation for the community is often missing.

**Q: What happens if contributors decrease?**
A: Information updates may stagnate. The process of correcting errors or bias can weaken. Consequently, the quality of internet knowledge declines.

**Q: How can users provide support?**
A: Avoid relying only on search summaries. Accessing the page directly helps motivate editors.

## Conclusion
The 25th anniversary of Wikipedia is a warning period. Data collection and fewer contributors suggest free knowledge may end. Knowledge requires social consensus for protection. The industry should establish compensation systems. If foundations weaken, technology built upon them may fail.
