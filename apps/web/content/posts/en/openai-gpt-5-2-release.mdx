On December 11, 2025, OpenAI officially unveiled its flagship model, **GPT-5.2**. (Solution)
This update goes beyond simple performance improvements, showcasing a form closer to the completion of 'Thinking AI.' In particular, front-end UI generation and agent tool usage capabilities have dramatically improved. (Evidence)

## Key Changes in GPT-5.2

### 1. xhigh Reasoning Mode
A **'xhigh'** reasoning stage has been introduced, surpassing the existing 'high'. This means the model thinks much deeper and more comprehensively before answering. It demonstrates overwhelming performance in complex mathematical proofs or large-scale system architecture design.

### 2. Client-side Compaction
A revolution in Long-term Memory. The `/responses/compact` endpoint intelligently summarizes and compresses conversation history, drastically reducing context window costs while retaining core memories.

### 3. Spreadsheet Understanding and Generation
Now, when you upload an Excel file, it goes beyond simple analysis to directly generate new sheets containing complex formulas and pivot tables.

## Tips for Developers
Call `gpt-5.2` in the API right now. We highly recommend experiencing the difference firsthand, especially with the `reasoning_effort: "xhigh"` setting.
