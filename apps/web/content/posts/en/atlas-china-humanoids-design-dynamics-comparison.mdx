# Atlas vs. Chinese Humanoids: A Clash of Design Philosophy and Dynamics

The competition in humanoid robots has evolved beyond simply creating walking machines into a field that tests fundamental design philosophies and the limits of dynamic control. When comparing Boston Dynamics' Atlas with China's Unitree H1 and Fourier GR-1, dynamic performance metrics like jump height and landing stability emerge as key differentiators of technological capability, surpassing mere specification numbers.

## Current Status: Investigated Facts and Data

Boston Dynamics completely transitioned Atlas from hydraulic to fully electric in 2024. The latest model is confirmed to be approximately 1.9 meters tall, weigh about 90 kilograms, and possess 56 degrees of joint freedom. Using high-power custom electric actuators, this robot can instantly lift a 50-kilogram load and operate on battery power for about 4 hours.

In the Chinese camp, Unitree H1 and Fourier GR-1 stand out. The H1 is 1.8 meters tall, weighs 47 kilograms, and can run at speeds up to 3.3 meters per second. The Fourier GR-1 features a relatively compact spec of 1.65 meters in height and 55 kilograms in weight. It is equipped with high-torque actuators allowing it to walk at 5 kilometers per hour and support a 50-kilogram load. The reported degrees of freedom for GR-1 vary between 40 and 54 across models.

## Analysis: Meaning and Impact

Evaluating a robot's performance based solely on basic metrics like height, weight, and number of joints has limitations. The true difference in technological sophistication is revealed in dynamic movements, particularly in high-difficulty tasks like jumping and landing. Jump height is determined by energy management and trajectory optimization through models like the spring-loaded inverted pendulum. More critical is the landing process. The stable two-foot landing (2-point landing) demonstrated by Atlas suggests a fundamentally different level of control compared to the four-point landings (using hands and feet) often seen in Chinese robots.

The key to securing landing stability lies in Model Predictive Control and Impedance Control algorithms. These technologies absorb impact with the ground and precisely control momentum. Furthermore, centroidal dynamics models and whole-body control algorithms perform real-time posture correction in mid-air and distribute ground reaction forces at the moment of landing. Behind Atlas's agile movements likely lies such a highly integrated control framework.

## Practical Application: How Readers Can Utilize This

This comparison shows that evaluating humanoid robot technology must go beyond simple specification comparison charts. Investors or industry observers should focus on dynamic performance—such as jumping, spinning, and recovery on unstable terrain—in manufacturer-released videos, rather than just static walking. Particularly, analyzing how a robot handles inertia and impact during the landing phase without additional support points can indirectly gauge the maturity of its underlying control software and algorithms.

For technology developers, it is important to understand that such high-performance dynamics are rooted in specific physical models and control theories. Concepts like the spring-loaded inverted pendulum model or centroidal dynamics are not merely academic theories but practical tools applied in designing extreme robot movements.

## FAQ: 3 Questions

**Q: What advantages does Atlas's 56 degrees of joint freedom provide compared to Chinese robots?**
A: More degrees of joint freedom enable more precise and human-like movements. Specifically, detailed joints in fingers and wrists enhance object manipulation capabilities, while additional degrees of freedom in the torso and legs contribute to complex dynamics and balance maintenance.

**Q: What is the most critical technical factor determining jump height?**
A: Jump height is comprehensively determined by the instantaneous power output and efficiency of the actuators, the mechanism by which the robot stores and releases energy (the principle of the spring-loaded inverted pendulum model), and the algorithms that optimize the jump trajectory.

**Q: What is the most significant change brought by the transition to electric actuation for humanoids?**
A: Electric designs have significantly improved cleanliness, energy efficiency, and maintenance ease compared to hydraulic systems. Furthermore, the fast response characteristics of electric motors enable more sophisticated torque control and rapid motion repetition, providing a platform better suited for software-based precise dynamic control.

## Conclusion: Summary + Actionable Insight

The showdown between Atlas and Chinese humanoid robots is taking place at a deeper level of dynamic control, beyond a competition of specifications. While Chinese robots showcase impressive hardware specs and speed, Boston Dynamics maintains an advantage in algorithms and control that shines in extreme movements. The true measure of technology may lie in how elegantly it lands on its feet alone after jumping down from a height.
