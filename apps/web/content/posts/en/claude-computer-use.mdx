Can legacy software without APIs be automated with AI? (Problem)
Anthropic gave Claude eyes (screenshot analysis) and hands (mouse/keyboard control) through the **Computer Use** tool. (Solution)
Now Claude can open a web browser, launch Excel, log in to an internal ERP system, and click buttons just like a human, without API integration. (Evidence)

## Features of Computer Use

### 1. Visual Grounding
Claude analyzes screen screenshots in real-time to find the coordinates (x, y) of buttons. If you say "Click the login button," it accurately identifies the login button somewhere on the screen.

### 2. Precise Control
- Delicate manipulation is possible through commands like `mouse_move`, `left_click`, `double_click`, `type`.
- Supports complex interactions like drag-and-drop and scrolling.

### 3. Bash Tool Integration
It doesn't just use the GUI; it can also perform hybrid tasks by opening a terminal (Bash) in the background to install necessary packages or manipulate the file system.

## Use Cases
- **Replacement for RPA**: You can automate repetitive data entry tasks with just Claude, without expensive RPA tools.
- **Software Testing**: Like a QA engineer, it performs E2E tests by running apps, pressing buttons, and checking for errors.

This technology means AI can handle all software in the digital world in the same way as humans. A truly 'General Purpose Agent' has been born.
