Artificial intelligence (AI) video generation technology has moved beyond the question of "what to show" and entered a phase of "how to control." For creators who previously had to input prompts and hope for the best, Google DeepMind has now provided a new set of reins. In January 2026, Google unveiled "Veo 3.1," a model that maximizes consistency and controllability in video generation, reshaping the video AI market landscape that had been dominated by OpenAI's Sora.

## 'Video Recipes' Completed with Visual Anchors

The core of Veo 3.1 is the "Ingredients to Video" feature. While previous models relied solely on text prompts and suffered from subtle changes in a character's face or background in every generation, Veo 3.1 utilizes up to three reference images as "visual anchors." When a creator inputs a specific character, background, or artistic style in image form, the AI recognizes these as absolute constraints to be maintained throughout the video.

The technical design is equally intriguing. Veo 3.1 combines a U-Net architecture including 3D convolutional layers with a 3D Latent Diffusion model. Rather than simply stitching flat images together, it processes spatiotemporal data integrally to preserve character identity. For example, even if a protagonist turns their head or moves under complex lighting, they do not lose the characteristics of the initial "ingredient images." This is expected to be a game-changer for Pixar-style animations and commercial advertising, where continuity is vital.

Furthermore, with this update, Google has placed 9:16 vertical video generation at the forefront. This is a strategic move targeting the mobile environment dominated by TikTok and YouTube Shorts. Creators can now immediately obtain high-definition results optimized for mobile without the need to forcedly crop or post-process horizontally generated videos. Through physics engine optimization, Google has also elevated the performance of dynamic physics simulations, such as human movement and the swaying of fabric.

## Sora Aims for 'Physics,' Veo Aims for 'Narrative'

The market naturally compares OpenAI's Sora with Veo 3.1. While Sora focuses on the "realism of a single shot" by perfectly mimicking the physical laws of the real world, Veo 3.1 places weight on "multi-shot connectivity." If a Sora video is a short film providing a miraculous visual experience, Veo 3.1 is closer to a production tool that allows editors to connect scenes as intended.

In particular, the "first frame and last frame specification" feature included in Veo 3.1 guarantees control over the narrative structure by allowing creators to define the beginning and end of a video. This is Google's strategic choice to solve the chronic problem of "randomness" often seen in AI videos. According to benchmark data, Veo 3.1 showed a performance improvement of over 20% compared to previous models in its ability to maintain character consistency during multi-scene generation.

However, concerns remain. Google has not disclosed the specific formulas for how the "Ingredients" feature weights are combined internally. Furthermore, the explanation regarding what specific algorithmic advancements were made in the physics engine optimization compared to the previous Veo remains ambiguous. As Sora strengthens its character maintenance capabilities through its "Cameo" feature, it remains to be seen how much of an overwhelming advantage Google's update will secure in actual production environments through user feedback.

## The Commencement of the AI Solo Production Era

Developers and creators can now deploy the capabilities of Veo 3.1 into practice through the Gemini API and Vertex AI. The specific use cases are clear: promotional videos for companies with strict brand guidelines, or the video adaptation of short-form webtoons where consistent characters must appear.

Solo creators can now mass-produce high-quality 9:16 Shorts videos using just one character sheet and one background photo they have drawn, without expensive filming equipment or complex 3D modeling. This goes beyond lowering the entry barrier for content creation; it will result in accelerating production speeds by dozens of times. Through this update, Google has solidified its intention to evolve from a mere "model provider" into an "AI Production Hub."

## FAQ: What You Need to Know About Veo 3.1

**Q: Are three images strictly required to use the 'Ingredients to Video' feature?**
**A:** No. You can selectively use anywhere from one to three images. If you only want to fix the character, use a character image; if you want to match the style and background as well, utilize all three. The more images provided, the more visual information the AI can reference, leading to higher consistency.

**Q: Has the existing 16:9 horizontal video generation capability been degraded?**
**A:** Not at all. Veo 3.1 supports all aspect ratios. The core of this update lies in optimization to enable high-quality generation in vertical formats without physical errors, expanding options for social media creators.

**Q: How long are the generated videos, and are they editable?**
**A:** It primarily generates high-quality short clips, which can be extended or edited using Google's Scene Extension tools. In particular, since the first and last frames can be directly specified, "match cut" tasks to naturally connect different clips have become much easier.

## Conclusion: The Era of Controlled Creativity

Google Veo 3.1 proves that AI video generation is no longer a "product of chance." Strong consistency through reference images and mobile optimization demonstrate that AI has evolved beyond a simple toy into a professional production tool.

The point we must watch moving forward is the shift in copyright and ethical guidelines brought about by such technology. In an era where anyone can create a video by putting someone else's image in as an "ingredient," how effectively the reliability tools introduced by Google can prevent misuse will determine the final report card for Veo 3.1. The ball is now in the creators' court. Is your recipe ready?
