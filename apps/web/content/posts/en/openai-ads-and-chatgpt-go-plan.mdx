The clean, white-toned chat interface from San Francisco has begun featuring 'Sponsored' labels. OpenAI, which has expanded its scale to manage trillions of won in operating costs, has finally played its monetization card: 'Advertising.' This signifies more than just a feature addition; it marks an inflection point where the generative AI industry, which once felt free of charge, is compromising with reality to find a sustainable business model.

## 'The Temptation of $8' and the Onslaught of Advertising

To diversify its revenue structure, OpenAI has fully implemented a policy to display advertisements to free users. Simultaneously, for users who found the existing $20 per month 'ChatGPT Plus' plan burdensome, the company is pilot-testing 'ChatGPT Go,' a low-cost plan priced at approximately $8 per month, in the U.S. market.

ChatGPT Go targets light users who want a pleasant, ad-free environment but do not require unlimited access to high-performance models. As of January 2026, OpenAI is adopting a strategy to retain its user base by extending access to high-performance models such as GPT-5.2 to this Go plan. While the higher-tier Plus plan provides professional-grade high query limits, the Go plan is an entry-level product focused on the core value of ad removal.

The advertisements introduced to the free tier differ from the typical banner ads we commonly see. They adopt a 'conversational recommended advertising' method where a 'Sponsored' label is attached to the bottom of a response to visually separate it from the content, while allowing users to ask follow-up questions about the advertisement. For example, if a user asks for travel plans, a specific airline or hotel booking service might be recommended at the end of the response. However, to maintain trust, sensitive topics such as health or politics, as well as accounts belonging to minors, are strictly excluded from ad exposure.

## The Value of Data Hidden Behind Monetization

The core principle OpenAI has put forward while introducing the advertising model is that "data is not sold directly to advertisers." However, it could not avoid policy changes that extend user data into the marketing domain. OpenAI has granted users the right to opt-out of ad personalization, but this comes at a cost. If ad personalization is disabled, the 'Tailored chat memories' feature—which remembers the context of previous conversations to reflect them in responses—may be restricted.

This presents users with a question: "Will you provide data to gain convenience, or will you protect your privacy and accept functional disadvantages?" Although OpenAI stated that it only provides 'aggregated performance metrics' rather than specific personal information to advertisers, it is an undeniable fact that the scope of data utilization has expanded now that users are exposed to ads based on conversational context.

From the perspective of OpenAI, which must improve profitability, the introduction of advertising was likely inevitable to cover server maintenance and model training costs that reach billions of dollars annually. However, concerns are also rising that in this process, AI could transform from a neutral information provider into a 'salesperson' influenced by specific capital interests.

## The User's Choice: To Pay or To See Ads

ChatGPT users now have clear options based on their usage patterns. For users who only ask a few light questions a day, the ad-supported free tier may be sufficient. However, for those who wish to avoid the fatigue caused by ad exposure, switching to the Go plan for $8 a month—the price of two cups of coffee—becomes a rational alternative.

Users who utilize AI for corporate or professional research purposes are still better off maintaining the $20 per month Plus plan. This is because, while the Go plan provides access to high-performance models, it differentiates itself from the Plus model regarding specific message query limits, image generation features, and the inclusion of Advanced Voice Mode.

For developers and marketers, this change also represents a new opportunity. With the emergence of 'conversational advertising' as a new medium, marketing strategies that naturally permeate a user's intent—moving beyond the era of simple keyword searches—are expected to become increasingly important.

## FAQ

**Q: If I subscribe to ChatGPT Go ($8), can I use the same features as Plus ($20)?**
A: No. ChatGPT Go is a plan focused on the core features of ad removal and access to high-performance models. The higher-tier Plus plan provides significantly higher daily message query limits and offers differentiated benefits in additional features such as image generation and Advanced Voice Mode.

**Q: Will my conversation content be sent directly to advertisers?**
A: OpenAI maintains the principle of not selling user data directly to external advertisers. Advertisers only receive anonymized and aggregated performance metrics. However, since the advertising system itself analyzes the user's conversational context to display appropriate ads, the scope of data utilization is broader than before.

**Q: What disadvantages are there if I turn off personalization settings because I don't want to see ads?**
A: You can opt-out of ad personalization, but in this case, the 'Tailored chat memories' feature, which provides customized information by remembering your previous conversations, may be limited. In other words, the continuity of conversation or the degree to which user preferences are reflected is likely to decrease.

## Conclusion

OpenAI's introduction of advertising and the launch of a low-cost plan are symbolic events showing that generative AI has evolved from an 'experimental tool' into a 'commercial platform.' It is a strategy to maximize profitability by offering ads to free users and price segmentation to paid users.

The key points to watch moving forward are how high the conversion rates for these 'conversational ads' will be without harming the user experience, and how they will share the market with existing search advertising giants like Google. The union of AI and capital has now officially entered its full trajectory.
