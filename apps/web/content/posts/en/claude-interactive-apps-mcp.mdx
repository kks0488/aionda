## TL;DR
- Anthropic added interactive app features for controlling external tools like Slack within Claude.
- These features use the Model Context Protocol to standardize data reading and actions.
- Users and AI collaborate in a shared workspace through the Agentic UI model.

Example: A person asks to share project updates in a chat window. A workspace opens on the side showing messenger components. The agent drafts content for a channel. It waits for the person to select the approval button.

## Status
On January 26, 2026, Anthropic released features for Claude users to interact with external apps. Initial integrations include Slack. Future connections to tools like Co-work are planned. This update aims to reduce context-switching costs between multiple apps. It provides an environment for processing business workflows within Claude.

The Model Context Protocol supports these changes. It was announced in November 2024. MCP is an open standard for connecting AI assistants to data systems. Through this protocol, Claude reads data from external apps. It performs actions in real-time. Past integrations required individual methods for each app. MCP unifies them into a single standard.

Claude utilizes the Artifacts feature introduced in June 2024. It displays agent tasks in a separate window. Users can monitor the agent drafting messages or editing code. They can intervene to modify outputs or approve executions.

## Analysis
This announcement shows a shift from conversation to execution. Chatbots function as agents with authority over productivity tools. This applies to corporate environments with complex collaboration structures.

The implementation of Agentic UI is a technical highlight. Anthropic presented a shared workspace where users and agents coexist. This approach addresses transparency by revealing agent operations. It helps solve the problem of opaque processing. Computer Use technology was released in October 2024. Combined with the app interface, agents operate tools by recognizing screens.

Security and permission management remain a challenge. Deeper integration increases the risk of accessing sensitive information. Technical details like web support for MCP require further verification. Latency during app execution also needs study. The human-in-the-loop model requires user approval. Its balance of speed and safety needs evaluation through future data.

## Practical Application
Enterprise managers can consider Claude as an agent connected to internal infrastructure. Reviewing specific points can help enhance operational efficiency.

**Checklist for Today:**
- Review technical specifications for connecting internal tools via MCP servers.
- Establish security guidelines and set access permissions for the agent.
- Design workflows that require user approval for high-risk tasks.

## FAQ
**Q: How does MCP differ from existing API integrations?**
A: Existing integrations required specific standards for each service. MCP standardizes how AI models interact with data sources. Developers can build servers according to the MCP standard. Claude then understands them to read data or perform actions.

**Q: Can the agent accidentally delete data or send incorrect messages?**
A: Anthropic used a human-in-the-loop design to prevent this. Checkpoints can be set to require user approval for execution. This applies even if the agent makes an autonomous judgment.

**Q: Can individual users use the Slack integration immediately?**
A: These features focus on enterprise workflows as of January 26, 2026. Further confirmation is needed regarding global deployment for general users.

## Conclusion
Claude's interactive apps have expanded AI roles to the execution stage. The MCP protocol lowers barriers to external tools. Artifacts ensure transparency in the agent ecosystem.

Success depends on expansion to more apps and addressing security issues. AI adoption strategies are moving beyond model selection. They now focus on how models connect with existing tools.
