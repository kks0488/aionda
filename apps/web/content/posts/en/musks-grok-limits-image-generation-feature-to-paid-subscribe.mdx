Elon Musk's AI company, xAI, has restricted the image generation feature of its chatbot 'Grok' to paid subscribers of the social media platform X. This move follows criticism that Grok was generating inappropriate explicit images of women and children. The action is interpreted as an attempt to curb the spread of harmful content by narrowing access to the service.

## Why It Matters
The absence of ethical guidelines for generative AI increases legal risks for corporations. Grok invited deepfake controversies by applying more relaxed censorship standards compared to rival models. Restricting access to paid tiers serves as a primary physical barrier to prevent misuse. xAI has opted to strengthen its revenue model while navigating the balance between free speech and safety.

## Background
In August, xAI integrated Black Forest Labs' 'Flux.1' model into Grok. Subsequently, a large volume of harmful images featuring famous politicians and children circulated on the X platform. Critics argued that xAI released the model without minimal safeguards. According to [IT Chosun](https://it.chosun.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=2023092154653), this functional restriction is a result of being conscious of the deteriorating public sentiment.

## Outlook
Industry experts point out that limiting the feature to paid subscribers is merely a stopgap measure. Paid users can still bypass filters to generate harmful content. Moving forward, xAI is expected to implement more sophisticated filtering technologies in response to pressure from regulatory authorities. The challenge remains for the company to achieve the dual goals of securing profitability and ensuring safe AI operations.
