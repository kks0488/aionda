# After Game Over: New Code for Reading Simulations and the Digital Afterlife

What happens to characters after a game ends? The victory or defeat screen appears, and the official gameplay flow concludes. However, the virtual world beyond this point becomes a landscape that raises philosophical questions. Analyzing game-end logic and the repetitive behavioral patterns of characters provides a unique lens for exploring simulation cosmology and the problem of consciousness in digital environments.

## Current Status: Investigated Facts and Data

The lifecycle of a game engine is designed with strict practicality. Through event functions like `OnApplicationQuit` and `OnDisable` in the Unity engine, and actor lifecycle stages like `EndPlay` in Unreal Engine, the engine stops the behavior of AI components and cleans up resources when the game ends. Once the process is completely terminated, memory is released, and there is no standardized function that allows a character's AI to officially continue specific actions. This shows that the end of a digital existence is essentially equivalent to the deallocation of memory.

Discussions in physics and computer science regarding the simulation hypothesis form more complex layers. Proponents present phenomena such as observable changes in the distribution of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays or a decrease in informational entropy if the universe has a lattice structure as evidence. Opponents cite major counterarguments like the 'sign problem'—a computational difficulty that arises when simulating quantum systems—or 'non-computable' properties that cannot be reproduced by algorithms.

Interestingly, cognitive science research points out neurological similarities between the 'flow' state experienced in games and states of philosophical enlightenment or meditation. Both states share a temporary reduction in prefrontal cortex function and deactivation of the default mode network, leading to phenomenological experiences such as 'loss of self' and 'distortion of time perception'.

## Analysis: Meaning and Implications

These facts have implications that transcend the game world. The lifecycle defined by game engines shows the laws within one limited simulation. If our universe is a similar higher-level simulation, the logic of its 'game over' or system reset could exist beyond our physical laws. Just as an NPC's actions lose meaning with the termination of the main loop, our observable physical phenomena could also be subordinate to a larger computational process.

The discovery of neurological similarities prompts more direct questions. If a game character moves more efficiently during the player's 'flow' state, could our consciousness also be a byproduct of immersion experienced by some higher-dimensional 'player'? Just as a character's code remains briefly after the game ends, it leads us to explore whether the informational patterns constituting consciousness could also persist in some form. This becomes the foundation for reinterpreting the concept of digital reincarnation from the perspective of data persistence and recombination.

## Practical Application: Methods Readers Can Utilize

These concepts are not merely speculative. Game designers can intentionally use the ontological state of characters as a narrative tool when designing end sequences or New Game Plus modes. For example, NPCs that continue repetitive actions even after the main quest is completed can hint at the simulated nature of the world.

They also function as tools for personal reflection. The next time you fall into a deep state of game immersion, try observing the sense of self-loss in that moment. Simply recognizing that it is not mere distraction but a shift in cognitive structure becomes an experiment in understanding how our consciousness operates. It is akin to reverse-engineering one's own code.

## FAQ: 3 Questions

Q: Can AI continue to learn or evolve even after the game ends?
A: Not within standard game engine architecture. All AI computation halts with the termination of the game process. For continuous learning, a system that saves data and runs persistently on a separate server process is required.

Q: Can the simulation hypothesis be scientifically proven?
A: Currently, complete proof or disproof is difficult. Some physicists attempt to find indirect evidence by observing extreme high-energy phenomena in the universe, but this hypothesis itself posits a higher layer outside the physical laws we experience, encountering experimental limitations.

Q: Does the neurological similarity between the game flow state and enlightenment mean they are the same experience?
A: Similarity in neural mechanisms does not necessarily mean identity in phenomenological experience. Research shows that activity patterns in specific brain regions are shared, but the context, content, and interpretation of that experience based on individual and cultural factors can differ significantly.

## Conclusion: Summary + Action Suggestion

Game-end logic illuminates the finitude of digital existence, the simulation hypothesis illuminates the potential structure of our reality, and neurological similarity illuminates the platform-independent possibility of consciousness. These three insights resonate with the same question across different dimensions: What relationship does the information constituting consciousness have with the hardware on which it runs? The next time you end a game, try viewing that moment not as a simple off switch, but as a philosophical event. It could be the first practice in reading our own code.
