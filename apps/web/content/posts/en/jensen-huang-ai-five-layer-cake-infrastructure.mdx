A physical transformation more massive than the invention of electricity or the rollout of global internet networks has begun. AI is now evolving beyond code on a screen into a massive physical entity composed of copper wires, concrete, and nuclear power plants. At the 2026 Davos Forum, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang defined this as the "largest construction project in human history" and unveiled the "Five-Layer Cake" model, a blueprint for the AI industry.

## From Smokeless Factories to Real Factories: The Reality of the Five-Layer Cake

The "Five-Layer Cake" proposed by Jensen Huang views the AI industry not as a simple software service, but as a massive high-tech manufacturing process spanning from raw material input to final product output. This model is built in layers from the bottom up: **Energy, Chips, Infrastructure, Models, and Applications.**

Energy forms the foundation. AI data centers consume up to 30 times more power than traditional cloud centers. NVIDIA converts this power into "Chips"—efficient computing power—and integrates them into a colossal machine called "Infrastructure," where tens of thousands of servers are organically connected. Only then can "Models" with intelligence run on top, creating economic value through the "Applications" we use. Huang dubbed this the "AI factory producing intelligence in real-time."

To build these massive factories, NVIDIA has joined forces with Wall Street, moving beyond Silicon Valley. The core of this movement is the "Global AI Infrastructure Investment Partnership (GAIIP)," formed alongside BlackRock and Microsoft. These entities have begun deploying astronomical capital to build not just data centers, but also Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) and renewable energy grids. The industry landscape has shifted toward a capital-intensive structure where tech companies are responsible for everything from energy supply to power grid modernization.

## Grid Screams and the Paradox of Capital

This strategy suggests that the bottleneck in the AI industry is no longer algorithms or data. The real challenge is "electricity." As national power grids struggle to handle surging AI demand, infrastructure development has become directly linked to national security. The involvement of giant asset managers like BlackRock is a necessary measure to overcome the capital limitations inherent to tech companies.

However, the outlook is not entirely without risk. The "Five-Layer Cake" model inevitably requires massive initial investment. As the cost of building infrastructure skyrockets, an "infrastructure gap" may emerge, preventing small and medium-sized AI companies from even entering the infrastructure layer. Furthermore, concerns remain that imbalances in power supply could stall the entire AI ecosystem if the acquisition of SMRs or renewable energy does not proceed as planned. Huang’s vision appears less like a technological gamble and more like the construction of a massive economic fortress designed to secure energy and capital while outpacing competitors.

## New Rules for Enterprises and Developers

Enterprises must now move beyond simply deciding which language model to adopt. It is time to determine where they will create value within the "Five-Layer Cake."

1. **Focus on Efficiency Over Direct Infrastructure Construction:** The Energy and Chip layers have become the exclusive domain of mega-capital. Rather than attempting to own infrastructure, general enterprises should compete in the "Model Optimization" and "Specialized Application" layers, delivering optimal performance while minimizing the consumption of computing resources.
2. **Include Energy Availability as a Business Metric:** When planning service expansion, companies must manage local power supply conditions and carbon emission regulations as core risks, rather than focusing solely on server costs.
3. **Monitor Vertical Integration:** Packaged infrastructure services that combine hardware, finance, and energy—modeled after the NVIDIA and BlackRock alliance—will become mainstream. It is crucial to design architectures that can operate flexibly within these massive ecosystems.

## FAQ

**Q: What is the most significant change introduced by the Five-Layer Cake model?**  
A: In the past, competition focused on software such as models and applications. Now, the "physical foundation" of energy and infrastructure has emerged as the key factor determining business success. AI is now being approached from a "manufacturing" perspective rather than a service one.

**Q: How does AI infrastructure specifically differ from traditional cloud computing?**  
A: Unlike the cloud, which primarily stores and retrieves data, AI infrastructure performs real-time inference and computation, generating immense heat and power consumption. Jensen Huang distinguishes these as "AI factories" with 30 times higher power density than existing facilities, emphasizing that high-density energy sources like nuclear power are essential.

**Q: How does the participation of financial firms like BlackRock impact technological development?**  
A: Private capital addresses the tens of billions of dollars in physical construction costs that tech companies cannot bear alone. While this accelerates AI infrastructure expansion, it also transforms the AI industry into a highly capital-intensive structure, potentially raising barriers to entry.

## Summary

Jensen Huang’s "Five-Layer Cake" declares that AI is no longer the exclusive domain of the digital world, but a physical infrastructure industry integrated with energy and hardware. The combination of capital (BlackRock) and technology (NVIDIA) is reshaping global power grids and industrial maps. The key point to watch moving forward is whether the economic value created by this massive infrastructure can be recovered quickly enough to justify the astronomical capital and energy costs involved.
