## TL;DR
- AI is being redefined as a five-layer physical infrastructure including energy and chips.
- Value creation now depends on stable physical resources rather than software performance alone.
- Organizations can develop strategies that integrate power supply and physical resource acquisition.

Example: Imagine cooling systems running to dissipate heat from large computing halls. Electricity flows through the grid and becomes machine intelligence. These processes help determine the success of various businesses.

AI systems are becoming infrastructure with physical foundations. Discussions at the World Economic Forum in January 2024 suggest a shift. Significant capital from firms like BlackRock is moving into national systems. Large-scale infrastructure construction has reportedly begun across the globe.

## Current Status: Restructuring the Ecosystem Around Infrastructure
The AI ecosystem is shifting into a framework connecting energy to various applications. NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang discussed a five-layer model in January 2024. This structure includes energy, chips, cloud data centers, AI models, and final applications.

This vision defines AI as critical infrastructure instead of a standalone technology. Value creation at the top layer relies on underlying energy and hardware layers. Collaboration with asset managers shows AI development is a large-scale capital project. It is comparable to building roads and ports.

NVIDIA is strengthening its position across these five layers for various governments. This approach aims to secure the physical ecosystem beyond cloud service providers.

## Analysis: Intelligence Production Driven by Energy and Capital
The center of the AI industry is shifting from algorithms to physical infrastructure. Hardware and power availability may become more important than software competition alone.

The five-layer model highlights the importance of the energy bottleneck. Energy and chip infrastructure are essential for generating revenue. Power grid expansion often moves slower than software updates. Large capital investment might lead to a concentration of intelligence production.

This framework could help sustain hardware demand by justifying capital expenditures. There is a risk of a bubble if applications do not show profit.

## Practical Application: Risk Management by Layer
Organizations can manage supply chain risks across all five layers. Operations require power even if hardware and models are available. Data sovereignty remains difficult to maintain without dedicated infrastructure. Decision-makers should assess their position within these layers to ensure resilience.

**Checklist for Today:**
- Verify if your AI services depend heavily on a specific region's power grid.
- Analyze how rising energy costs might impact your total computing expenses.
- Review strategies for securing independent infrastructure to prepare for cloud outages.

## FAQ
**Q: Why is energy the bottom-most layer of the infrastructure?**  
A: AI computation converts electrical energy into intelligence. Upper layers often require a stable power supply to function.

**Q: Do general enterprises need to manage all five layers?**  
A: They can benefit from understanding the dependencies of each layer. Developers should monitor the energy stability of their cloud provider.

**Q: Why are financial institutions like BlackRock participating in this discussion?**  
A: Building AI infrastructure requires capital beyond the capacity of one company. This work shares characteristics with large national infrastructure investments.

## Conclusion
AI is moving beyond screens into the reality of power grids. Jensen Huang’s five layers visualize the structure of intelligence production. Future success may depend on whether value justifies the high construction costs. Energy and capital efficiency are becoming the new standards for AI competition.
