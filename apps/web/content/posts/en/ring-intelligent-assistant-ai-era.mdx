Ring is transforming from a doorbell camera company into an AI assistant platform. Founder Jamie Siminoff returned after two years to unveil a new vision at CES 2026. His declaration—"Turn AI backwards and you get IA: Intelligent Assistant"—could become a game changer for the smart home market.

## Current State

Jamie Siminoff sold Ring to Amazon in 2018 and stepped back in 2023, citing burnout. What brought him back was the Palisades fires—the garage where Ring was born burned down. He has now returned as Amazon VP overseeing Ring, Blink, Key, and Sidewalk.

Key features announced at CES 2026:

**Alexa+ Greetings**: The doorbell recognizes visitors and converses with them. It can direct delivery drivers to "go to the back door" or politely decline door-to-door salespeople. AI analyzes visitors' clothing, what they're holding, and their behavior to determine who they are.

**Familiar Faces**: Learns faces of frequent visitors like family and babysitters, sending notifications like "Mom is here" by name.

**Fire Watch**: Ring cameras detect smoke and flames using AI. Partners with nonprofit Watch Duty for firefighting response.

**Unusual Event Alerts**: Learns daily patterns around your home and only alerts when anomalies are detected.

## Analysis

Siminoff's vision centers on "reducing cognitive load." Instead of users constantly checking footage and making judgments, AI understands context and handles it automatically. This attempts to solve the fundamental smart home problem—notification fatigue.

However, privacy concerns are growing. The EFF (Electronic Frontier Foundation) and Senator Ed Markey publicly opposed the Familiar Faces feature. Ring's partnerships with law enforcement through Flock Safety and Axon are also controversial. Critics argue that private camera networks could effectively become surveillance infrastructure.

Siminoff defends by emphasizing "user choice." He cited how Ring footage contributed to apprehending the Brown University shooting suspect. Convenience and security versus privacy—where to draw this line ultimately falls to consumers.

## Practical Applications

If you're a Ring user, several decisions await:

1. **Alexa+ Greetings**: Requires Ring Wired Doorbell Pro (3rd gen) or Plus (2nd gen) + Ring Premium Plan. Useful if you receive frequent deliveries.

2. **Familiar Faces**: Convenient but facial data is stored on Amazon servers. Activating without family consent is not recommended.

3. **Fire Watch**: Offers tangible value for residents in wildfire-prone areas like California.

If privacy is your priority, you can use basic recording functions only and disable AI features. However, the deeper you go into Amazon's ecosystem, the fewer choices you have.

## FAQ

**Q: Is Alexa+ Greetings available on all Ring products?**

A: No. Currently only supported on Ring Wired Doorbell Pro (3rd gen) and Ring Wired Doorbell Plus (2nd gen), requiring a Ring Premium Plan subscription. Available in English only in the US and Canada.

**Q: Where is Familiar Faces facial data stored?**

A: On Amazon's cloud. Users can request deletion, but the possibility of disclosure to law enforcement upon request remains.

**Q: Can existing Ring cameras use Fire Watch?**

A: Yes, footage from existing Ring cameras is included in AI analysis. Real-time fire information can be viewed in the Fire Watch section of the Neighbors app.

## Conclusion

Ring's AI transition shows the direction of the smart home market. From simple recording to contextual understanding, from manual checking to automatic response. The question is how this convenience trades off against privacy. For Siminoff's "cognitive load reduction" to be realized, users must be able to "cognize" where their data goes. Read the settings menu before enabling features.
