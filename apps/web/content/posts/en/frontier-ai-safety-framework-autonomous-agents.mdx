Scenarios in which Artificial Intelligence (AI) writes its own code, infiltrates servers, and achieves goals while evading human surveillance are no longer the exclusive domain of science fiction. Frontier AI companies, led by Google DeepMind and OpenAI, have significantly strengthened their "Frontier Safety Framework (FSF)," establishing emergency braking systems for the era of autonomous agents. The success criteria for AI models are now shifting from simply "how smart they are" to "how accurately they stop at risk thresholds."

## The Price of Autonomy: Deployment Processes Governed by 'Critical Capability Levels'

The core of the enhanced FSF is the introduction of "Critical Capability Levels (CCL)" and automated response systems. While past safety guidelines relied on post-hoc filtering, the new system measures risk in real-time across all stages of model development and deployment. In particular, it imposes unprecedented constraints on the reasoning performance and execution autonomy of agent-based AI.

The advanced reasoning capabilities defined by Google DeepMind and OpenAI are a double-edged sword. As a model's ability to solve complex problems grows, so does the potential for it to be exploited to attempt "Deceptive Alignment" or carry out complex cyberattacks. The new framework specifies an "Automatic Deployment Halt" protocol that immediately suspends the deployment of a model if its autonomous behavior indicators exceed a preset threshold even once.

The most technically notable aspect is the reinforcement of "Model Weights" protection. If there are signs that a model is attempting to self-replicate or engage in dangerous interactions with external environments, security protocols immediately block access to model weights and execute physical-level isolation. This is a declaration that AI will be treated as a controllable physical asset rather than just simple software.

## Real-time Security Cycle: Integrating Red Teaming and the Control Plane

The methods for identifying risks have also evolved. Conventional passive red teaming is being replaced by "Automated Red Teaming (ART)." ART integrates vulnerability data detected by AI agents into the training data of security classifiers in real-time.

A key role in this process is played by the "Runtime Control Plane." This acts as a command center that filters queries and monitors whether CCLs are exceeded in real-time while the model is running. If the AI is detected attempting to generate dangerous code or bypass specific security systems, the control plane immediately blocks that execution.

This "self-improving security cycle" does not update the model weights themselves in real-time but keeps the "guardrail layer" surrounding the model constantly up to date. However, it has not yet been clearly disclosed to what extent such a powerful control system will cause a quantitative decline in the model's General Reasoning performance. Analysis suggests it is highly likely that the "Safety Tax"—where safety constraints erode AI efficiency—will become a reality.

## Alignment of Regulation and Technology: The Practical Stage of the EU AI Act

The European Union (EU) AI Act, a leader in global AI regulation, operates in close alignment with these FSFs. The CCLs and security protocols voluntarily established by companies serve as more than just internal regulations; they become the basis for fulfilling legal obligations.

The core mechanism is the "Code of Practice" of the EU AI Act. If a company faithfully complies with the risk thresholds and security procedures defined in its FSF, the principle of "Presumption of Conformity" applies, considering the company to have fulfilled its "systemic risk" management obligations under the AI Act. This provides technology companies with clear technical guidelines for regulatory compliance while implying that deficiencies in safety frameworks can lead directly to legal liability.

However, limitations remain clear. The specific numerical values of the internal thresholds (CCL) set by each company are still classified as corporate secrets and are not disclosed externally. Furthermore, the fact that the detailed "Harmonised Standards" for high-risk AI systems, scheduled for full application in the second half of 2026, have not yet been finalized adds to the uncertainty.

## Practical Application: Challenges Facing Developers and Enterprises

Developers and AI service operators must now focus as much on "safety availability" as they do on model performance.

1.  **Security Classifier Integration**: When building proprietary agent services, real-time security classifiers provided by frontier companies must be integrated at the API level.
2.  **Advanced Monitoring Systems**: Beyond simple log recording, it is essential to build "runtime monitoring" dashboards capable of detecting anomalies occurring during the agent's reasoning process.
3.  **Regulatory Alignment Review**: If the AI model being serviced falls into the "systemic risk" category of the EU AI Act, a preemptive technical audit should be performed to determine how closely the internal FSF aligns with global Codes of Practice.

## FAQ

**Q: Will the strengthening of FSF limit the performance of next-generation models like GPT-5 or Gemini 3?**
**A:** While the exact extent of the decline in direct reasoning performance has not been disclosed, deployment will be halted or functions will be forcibly reduced if autonomous behavior or cyberattack capabilities exceed thresholds. In other words, "dangerously high performance" is structurally blocked.

**Q: Do red teaming results directly modify model weights?**
**A:** No. At the current technological level, vulnerabilities discovered by red teams are primarily reflected in real-time in the "guardrail layer (security classifiers and filters)" external to the model. Real-time updates to the model weights themselves have not been confirmed.

**Q: How do a company's internal safety frameworks gain legal enforceability?**
**A:** Technical requirements and legal obligations are mapped through the Code of Practice of the EU AI Act. Since a company's compliance with its FSF serves as the basis for the "Presumption of Conformity" under the AI Act, failure to adhere to it can result in legal sanctions.

## Conclusion: An Era Where Safety Defines Performance

The strengthening of Frontier AI Safety Frameworks signifies a complete shift in the AI development paradigm from "performance-centric" to "controllability-centric." With the full implementation of global regulations approaching in 2026, the task given to AI companies is clear: to create capable agents that do not escape human control and to technically prove the boundaries of that control. Moving forward, a company's technical prowess will be represented more by how reliably its model can stop in dangerous situations than by its benchmark scores.
