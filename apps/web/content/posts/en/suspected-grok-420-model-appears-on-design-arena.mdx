xAI has unveiled a new version of its high-performance AI model, 'Grok.' This latest iteration significantly outperforms 'Grok 4.20 (estimated),' which surfaced just a few days ago. In early benchmark evaluations, the model demonstrated performance levels comparable to the next-generation models from Google and Anthropic.

## Why It Matters

The new Grok model exhibits exceptional metrics in the domains of reasoning and coding. Industry analysts suggest that this model has reached the level of Gemini 3 Pro or Claude Opus 4.5, signaling a narrowing technical gap within the closed-source model market.

xAI has improved response speeds by efficiently allocating compute resources. Through a proprietary architecture design, the company successfully reduced data processing latency. Advanced training optimization techniques served as the primary catalyst for these performance gains.

## Background

The recently released 'Grok 4.20' fell short of state-of-the-art (SOTA) standards, showing strengths only in specific datasets. In contrast, the new model achieved consistently high scores across general-purpose AI performance benchmarks.

Elon Musk has invested massive capital into a supercomputing cluster in Tennessee. A total of 100,000 NVIDIA H100 GPUs were deployed for model training. This large-scale computing infrastructure facilitated the rapid upgrade and deployment of the model.

## Outlook

The market is closely monitoring real-time ranking fluctuations on the [LMSYS Chatbot Arena](https://chat.lmsys.org/?leaderboard). A key focal point is whether the new Grok can surpass OpenAI’s GPT-4o. xAI’s aggressive strategy is expected to further accelerate the performance race among Big Tech companies.
