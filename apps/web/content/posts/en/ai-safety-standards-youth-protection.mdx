The collaboration between OpenAI and Common Sense Media marks a technical turning point in youth protection. AI services are now mandated to establish age verification and risk detection systems. This has evolved beyond simple recommendations into legal regulations and standardized benchmarks.

## Current Status: Technical Standards and Regulatory Environment

California Proposition 24 requires a "reasonable level of certainty" depending on the service risk level [Proposition 24 - Text of Proposed Laws](https://oag.ca.gov/system/files/initiatives/pdfs/19-0021A1%20%28Consumer%20Privacy%20-%20Version%201%29_0.pdf). A method where the operating system (OS) delivers anonymized age signals to apps has emerged as a device-level alternative [California Age-Appropriate Design Code (ADCA)](https://fpf.org/blog/california-age-appropriate-design-code-aims-to-address-growing-concern-about-childrens-online-privacy-and-safety/). Collected age information must be destroyed immediately after verification, and sharing with third parties is strictly prohibited [California Introduces New Age Verification Requirements (AB-1043)](https://www.huntonprivacyblog.com/2025/10/28/california-introduces-new-age-verification-requirements-for-software-applications/).

AI detection of self-harm and risky text is based on the MLCommons AI Safety benchmark [Announcing MLCommons AI Safety v0.5 Proof of Concept](https://mlcommons.org/2024/04/mlcommons-ai-safety-v0-5-poc/). Models must sophisticatedly distinguish between simple mentions and specific suicidal intent [Moderation - OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/moderation/overview). The 'DeepSuiMind' dataset measures even implicit intent hidden within metaphorical expressions [Can Large Language Models Identify Implicit Suicidal Ideation? An Empirical Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10014).

## Analysis: Expansion of Regulatory Scope and Changes in Design Principles

The US federal law COPPA limits its protection targets to children under the age of 13 [COPPA vs the California Age-Appropriate Design Code (CA AADC) - Pixalate](https://www.pixalate.com/blog/coppa-vs-the-california-age-appropriate-design-code-ca-aadc). In contrast, the California bill expands its protection to all minors under 18 [California's Age-Appropriate Design Code Act – and the looming state patchwork](https://www.dlapiper.com/en-us/insights/publications/2023/05/californias-age-appropriate-design-code-act). Any general service that children are likely to access now falls under regulatory scrutiny.

AI startups must now mandatory conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) before launch [California Enacts the California Age-Appropriate Design Code Act](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/california-enacts-the-california-age-4357731/). From the design stage, services must incorporate default settings that serve the "best interests of children" [California's Age-Appropriate Design Code Act – and the looming state patchwork](https://www.dlapiper.com/en-us/insights/publications/2023/05/californias-age-appropriate-design-code-act). This makes public safety policy disclosure and external audits essential elements of the development process.

## Practical Application: Guidelines for AI Services

When integrating age verification technology, developers must prioritize the principle of data minimization [California Age-Appropriate Design Code (ADCA)](https://fpf.org/blog/california-age-appropriate-design-code-aims-to-address-growing-concern-about-childrens-online-privacy-and-safety/). Open-source guardrail models such as Llama Guard can be utilized for filtering harmful content [Llama Guard: LLM-based Input-Output Safeguard for Human-AI Conversations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06674). A technical balance is required to send notifications to parents upon risk detection while ensuring user privacy.

## FAQ

**Q: What is the critical difference between existing COPPA and the California bill?**
**A:** While COPPA focuses on parental consent, the California bill mandates design that is favorable to children [COPPA vs the California Age-Appropriate Design Code (CA AADC) - Pixalate](https://www.pixalate.com/blog/coppa-vs-the-california-age-appropriate-design-code-ca-aadc).

**Q: Is it permissible to store ID information collected for age verification on a server?**
**A:** No. It must be deleted immediately after the verification purpose is achieved, and use for any other purpose is prohibited [Proposition 24 - Text of Proposed Laws](https://oag.ca.gov/system/files/initiatives/pdfs/19-0021A1%20%28Consumer%20Privacy%20-%20Version%201%29_0.pdf).

**Q: Is it actually possible for AI to detect implicit suicidal intent?**
**A:** Detection performance for metaphorical expressions is continuously measured through the latest datasets such as DeepSuiMind [Can Large Language Models Identify Implicit Suicidal Ideation? An Empirical Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10014).

## Conclusion: Recommendations for a Safe AI Ecosystem

AI protection for minors has evolved from a technical choice into a legal requirement. Companies must integrate age verification systems and comply with strengthened harmful content filtering standards. Implement a Data Protection Impact Assessment immediately to demonstrate the safety of your service.
