AI does not understand the physical world because it has learned video as a sequence of image frames. The solution lies in the integrated learning of video data itself, supported by the massive expansion of data centers.

## Video Is Not Just a Sequence of Images

Until now, AI has processed video as a series of still images due to a lack of computational resources. Consequently, models understood temporal flow in a fragmented manner, which created limitations in grasping physical causality.

## Removing Computational Constraints and World Models

Data center expansion is shifting the training paradigm. AI is beginning to learn from video in its complete form. This is the process of building a true "World Model," where models extract physical laws directly from visual data.

## Combining Reasoning Innovation and Continuous Learning

Physical understanding is only one component of intelligence. Łukasz Kaiser emphasizes reasoning capabilities; the ability to formulate the theory of relativity is more significant than the ability to move a chair. Research into Continuous Learning is at the core of this evolution.

## Limitations and Alternative Perspectives

World models do not solve all intelligence problems. Visual learning alone cannot perfectly guarantee abstract logic. Furthermore, data bias carries the risk of distorting physical laws. Ultimately, architectural efficiency is more critical than mere model size.

## FAQ

**Q: Is it possible to understand physical laws through video learning alone?**  
A: AI identifies the causal relationships inherent in visual data as patterns.

**Q: How does continuous learning differ from traditional methods?**  
A: It reflects new information in real-time without the "catastrophic forgetting" of existing knowledge.

**Q: Does securing computational resources directly equate to model performance?**  
A: Resources are a necessary condition. Innovation in reasoning algorithms is the sufficient condition.

## Physical Intelligence Built by Data Centers

Integrated video learning completes the understanding of temporal causality. This serves as the key to solving singularity benchmarks. We are witnessing the birth of physical world models. We must pay close attention to technological moats and monitor the reasoning performance of these models.
