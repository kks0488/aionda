"JSON Parsing Failed". This was one of the error messages that tormented AI developers the most. (Problem)
Through the **Structured Outputs** feature, OpenAI introduced a technology that forces model outputs to **100% perfectly adhere** to the JSON schema defined by the developer. (Solution)
Now, you no longer need to fix broken brackets with complex regular expressions or write Retry logic. (Evidence)

## 100% Reliability

### Difference from Existing JSON Mode
The existing `response_format: { type: "json_object" }` merely mimicked the JSON form and could not prevent specific fields from being missing or types from being wrong.
**Structured Outputs** uses a **Constrained Sampling** technique that sets the generation probability of tokens that do not fit the schema to 0% at the LLM's token sampling stage. Therefore, schema violation is theoretically impossible.

## How to Use

### Integration with Pydantic/Zod
Just define the data structure with Python's Pydantic or TypeScript's Zod library and pass it to the API.

```python
class UserProfile(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int
    interests: list[str]

completion = client.beta.chat.completions.parse(
    model="gpt-5.1",
    response_format=UserProfile,
    messages=[...]
)
```

## Impact of Introduction
- **Code Simplification**: Defensive Coding is drastically reduced.
- **Safety Improvement**: Prevents system crashes caused by AI spitting out weirdly formatted data.
- **RAG Quality Improvement**: Useful for building structured databases by extracting only accurate fields from search results.
