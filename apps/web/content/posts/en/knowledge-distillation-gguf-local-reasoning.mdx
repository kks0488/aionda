## TL;DR
- **What is the change?**.
A trend is expanding where the reasoning capabilities of large models are ported to smaller models through knowledge distillation, which are then run in local environments using GGUF quantization.
- **Why is it important?**: It enables high efficiency at a low cost.
For instance, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B recorded 72.6% on AIME 2024, surpassing the commercial model o1-mini (63.6%).
- **What should readers do?**.
Check your hardware's VRAM capacity, install a suitable GGUF model, and utilize it for high-difficulty logic tasks while resolving security and cost concerns.

Example: A researcher sits in front of a personal computer and disconnects the network. They immerse themselves in research without security worries, watching the device solve complex mathematical formulas on its own without external assistance.

## Current Status: Cloning the Giant's Thought Process
A representative example is the `DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B` model, which was trained by distilling the reasoning capabilities of the DeepSeek-R1 model into a smaller architecture using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on reasoning data.

The influence of these distilled models is proven by metrics. The `DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B` model, which inherited the reasoning capabilities of DeepSeek-R1, recorded 94.3% on the MATH-500 benchmark. This is higher than the 90.0% recorded by o1-mini on the same benchmark. Additionally, a Llama-70B-based distilled model achieved a performance of 70.0% on AIME 2024, expanding the performance boundaries of open-source models.

Economic efficiency has also been confirmed. The cost of data generation for training certain distilled models is known to be around $52.30 (USD), demonstrating the possibility of building high-performance reasoning models at a low cost. Models trained in this manner are converted to the GGUF format and can be run in a 4-bit quantized state on standard user hardware.

## Analysis: Where Efficiency Supports Performance
The combination of knowledge distillation and GGUF is shifting AI utilization from cloud dependency to local autonomy. In the past, large models with hundreds of billions of parameters were required to process complex logical structures. Now, however, models at the 32B level can secure competitiveness by learning from high-quality reasoning data generated by larger models.

However, there are points to consider. The Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) method merely mimics the output of the teacher model, which may differ from Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based reasoning where the model explores new logical paths on its own. Furthermore, it is difficult to predict performance changes based on data volume because it is unclear what specific sample scales figures like '250x' in dataset names represent. Additional comparative data is also needed to determine how subtle performance changes occurring during GGUF quantization act as variables in math or coding tasks that require high precision.

Nevertheless, the impact on the industry is significant. Instead of paying high API costs, companies can adopt a strategy of enhancing data security and reducing costs by operating distilled models specialized for specific fields locally.

## Practical Application
To apply this technology to actual work.
Individual developers or researchers should find an appropriate compromise between the model's inference density and the hardware's memory bandwidth.

**Things to do today:**
- Check the VRAM capacity of your local GPU and select the optimal version between 4-bit or 6-bit GGUF quantized models accordingly.
- Use complex mathematical or logical problems to verify if the distilled model correctly outputs the Chain of Thought (CoT).
- Evaluate task suitability by comparing the response speed and accuracy of reasoning-specific models and general-purpose models using the same prompts.

## FAQ
**Q: Are SFT-based distilled models less performant than RL-based models?**
A: Theoretically, RL allows a model to extend its logic by correcting its own errors, while SFT is advantageous for quickly absorbing the response styles of verified teacher models. As seen in the DeepSeek-R1-Distill case, SFT using high-quality data alone can result in performance that surpasses commercial models on certain benchmarks.

**Q: Does GGUF quantization lower inference accuracy?**
A: Recent quantization technology maintains the core of reasoning capabilities even at the 4-bit level. However, for tasks requiring sophisticated numerical calculations or complex context understanding, using 6-bit or 8-bit versions is more stable; this is a factor to choose based on the user's available VRAM.

A: Regardless of the model's performance, you should check the license of the underlying dataset and the terms of use of the original model used for distillation. A separate review is required regarding legal rights and relationships.

## Conclusion
Knowledge distillation of high-performance reasoning models and GGUF optimization are driving forces that increase the accessibility of AI technology. The fact that reasoning tasks, which used to be expensive, can be replaced with low training costs and personal hardware is affecting the economic structure of the AI industry. In the future, the criteria for technical superiority will be based on how much high-density reasoning data a model has learned, rather than its size. The trend of supplementing hardware limitations with the intelligent distillation of software is expected to establish itself as a major feature of the local AI ecosystem.
