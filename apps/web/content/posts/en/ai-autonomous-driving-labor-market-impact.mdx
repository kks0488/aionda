# AI and Autonomous Driving Reshape the Labor Market: Over 100,000 Jobs at Risk in 5 Years

From 2025 to 2030, even considering only the automotive, semiconductor, and transportation industries, a projection suggests that a minimum of over 100,000 jobs annually could be replaced by AI and automation technologies. The displacement effect of technology is now expanding beyond assembly lines to include bus drivers, taxi drivers, freight transport workers, and even professionals in accounting, legal, and finance sectors. How to manage the gap between the pace of technological advancement and structural changes in the labor market has emerged as a societal challenge.

## Current Status: Investigated Facts and Data

According to analyses by the Korea Employment Information Service and the Korea Industrial Technology Promotion Agency, employment trends in major industries in 2025 are mixed. The semiconductor industry is projected to see a 2.2% increase (approximately 3,000 people) in employment compared to the previous year, driven by strong exports due to AI market growth. The automotive industry saw a 1.6% increase in the first half of the year due to expanding demand for eco-friendly vehicles, but is expected to remain flat in the second half due to general economic uncertainty. The transportation and warehousing industry saw employment increase by 41,000 people in November 2025 compared to the same month the previous year, continuing service-led employment growth.

Separate from these short-term increases, mid-to-long-term automation risks are severe. Previous studies by the OECD and McKinsey estimate that 15-30% of jobs worldwide could be automated by 2030. For Korea, the potential for automation replacement is about 25-26% based on working hours. Analysis by the domestic research institute KDI is more direct. Already, 38.8% of domestic jobs belong to a high-risk group where over 70% of tasks can be automated. After 2030, not only manufacturing jobs but also professional tasks in fields like law (74%) and teaching (64%) are highly likely to be over 60-70% automated.

## Analysis: Meaning and Impact

These figures show that technological displacement is no longer an abstract future risk. It is a structural change currently underway. In particular, the automotive and transportation industries stand at the forefront, directly impacted by autonomous driving technology, transcending the boundaries of traditional manufacturing and logistics. The semiconductor industry shows a contradictory pattern, with job increases due to rising demand for AI chips, while some occupations may disappear due to highly automated processes.

The biggest challenge stems from the gap between the pace of technological development and the labor market's adaptive capacity. Workers in occupations with high automation risk require time and systematic support to acquire the skills needed for the new technological environment. It remains uncertain how well current retraining programs can bridge this gap.

## Practical Application: Methods Readers Can Utilize

Policymakers and corporate HR managers should focus on upgrading rather than simply replacing jobs. The domestic K-Digital Training program has shown visible results in nurturing talent in new technology fields, with an employment rate of about 67-68% based on 2021-2022 standards. However, challenges remain for improvement, as about 36% of trainees fail to find employment, and there are significant quality gaps between training institutions.

Individual workers need proactive learning that goes beyond passive participation in retraining. They should identify which parts of their job tasks have high automation potential and invest in strengthening analytical, emotional, and creativity-based competencies that can complement or collaborate with AI. While utilizing systems like the National Tomorrow Learning Card, careful selection is necessary, considering the effectiveness of training and regional imbalances in opportunities.

## FAQ

**Q: Which occupational groups are primarily concentrated with unemployment risks due to AI?**
A: Initially, simple repetitive tasks in manufacturing were threatened, but the scope has now expanded to include rule-based physical labor like driving jobs in transportation, and even professions with high proportions of data analysis and document processing, such as legal services or accounting. According to KDI analysis, 38.8% of domestic jobs belong to the high-risk group.

**Q: Are government retraining programs actually effective?**
A: In the case of K-Digital Training, it shows an employment rate of about 67-68%, but about 36% of trainees fail to find employment. There are significant quality differences between training institutions, and specialized support and performance analysis for mid-skilled workers who have actually lost jobs to automation are still considered insufficient.

**Q: Is the 25-26% automation replacement rate by 2030 a confirmed figure?**
A: No. This is a projection figure based on previous studies by organizations like the OECD. Due to the rapid development of generative AI, research institutions sometimes adjust their estimates upward. The actual scale of job reduction can vary depending on various factors beyond technical feasibility, such as economic implementation costs, policies, and social consensus.

## Conclusion

The impact of AI and autonomous driving on the labor market is on a different scale and speed compared to previous technological changes. The projection that over 100,000 jobs annually could be affected is a warning signal. What we need is not to stop technological progress, but a systematic social response strategy to manage the inequality it may cause and to integrate workers into the new ecosystem. Along with data-based continuous monitoring, improving the quality of retraining programs and providing targeted support have emerged as urgent tasks.
