# AI-Generated Images, Platform Responsibility: The Regulatory Challenge of Harmful Generative AI Content

Technical vulnerabilities are being revealed where generative AI can be misused to mass-produce non-consensual sexual imagery or child abuse content. The gap between app store policies and their actual enforcement, along with the limited legal liability of platforms for AI-generated content, presents new regulatory challenges.

## Current Status: Investigated Facts and Data

The effectiveness of safety filters in major generative AI models shows significant variation. DALL-E 3, which introduced prompt rewriting and multi-stage output filtering, is evaluated as having the highest defense capability. In contrast, the open-source model Stable Diffusion, which allows users to disable its safety checker, is pointed out as being the most vulnerable to generating harmful content. Midjourney operates keyword blocking and community guidelines but remains at a mid-level of defense, exposed to filter bypasses through visual descriptions.

In the legal domain, the standards for platform liability are also being shaken. There is a growing trend in applying the principle that under Section 230 of the U.S. Communications Decency Act, platforms may be considered 'information content providers' and lose immunity if they directly create or modify content through AI. The recent *Anderson v. TikTok* ruling interpreted algorithmic curation as outside the scope of immunity, expanding platform liability.

## Analysis: Meaning and Impact

This technological gap signifies the absence of a single standardized safety mechanism and implies the risk that the most vulnerable model becomes the main channel for harmful content production. Even if app store policies exist, if their enforcement is selective or slow, it can undermine the credibility of the policies themselves and result in the unchecked spread of harmful content.

Changes in legal precedent are moving towards imposing a more proactive duty of intervention on platforms. The European Union's Digital Services Act emphasizes platforms' obligations for ex-ante risk management and operational transparency regarding AI-generated content, rather than direct immunity. This suggests that platforms have a responsibility to control harmfulness from the system design stage, moving beyond simple ex-post deletion.

## Practical Application: Methods Readers Can Utilize

Technology developers and policymakers need to collaborate on strengthening the safety frameworks of the most vulnerable open-source models. This includes continuous monitoring and patching of filter bypass techniques, and restricting the distribution of tools that neutralize safety measures. As the boundary between algorithmic curation and content creation becomes blurred, platform operators must reassess whether their services can still be protected by legal immunity.

## FAQ: 3 Questions

**Q: What should general users do when they discover harmful content generated by AI?**
A: They should immediately report it through the reporting system of the platform where the content is posted. Most major platforms and app stores operate reporting channels for harmful content.

**Q: Is there an official ranking or score for the efficiency of safety filters by AI model?**
A: Currently, no specific, official, single comparative metric for the precision and recall of harmful content blocking per model has been made public. Benchmark results may vary by research institution.

**Q: In the case of deepfake videos made by AI, what legal liability do platforms have?**
A: In the U.S., platform immunity may be limited if the platform is judged to have materially contributed to the creation of the content. In the EU, under the Digital Services Act, platforms have an obligation to assess and mitigate systemic risks.

## Conclusion: Summary + Action Proposal

The problem of harmful content from generative AI is a complex threat where technological vulnerabilities, gaps in policy enforcement, and evolving legal liability frameworks intersect. For a comprehensive solution, all stakeholders—from model developers to platforms and regulators—must collaborate not only on a unified safety standard but also on clarifying accountability across the entire system. It is time to maintain continuous attention on legal test cases and policy discussions to ensure regulation does not lag behind the pace of technological advancement.
