Technical predictions from 2019 missed the mark. 5G-based connected cars have largely vanished from the spotlight. In their place, Large Language Models (LLMs) have filled the void. 2025 marks the inaugural year of a technological "minor singularity."

Past predictions were obsessed with physical connectivity. In reality, progress manifested as an explosion of intelligence. AI now outperforms humans in logic and mathematics, yet it still lacks the nuances of everyday conversation. This imbalance defines the core landscape of 2025.

## The Rapid Leap in STEM Intelligence

LLMs have exceeded expectations in the domain of logical reasoning. OpenAI’s o1 model solves complex physics problems, as evidenced by [LiveCodeBench](https://livecodebench.github.io/) data. AI has moved beyond simple sentence generation; it has reached human-expert levels in code optimization and mathematical proofs.

## The Illusion of 5G and Connected Cars

In 2019, the central keyword was 5G private networks. The consensus was that autonomous driving and real-time vehicle connectivity would become mainstream. In reality, these ambitions were blocked by high infrastructure cost barriers. Local computing power proved to be more critical than low-latency communication. Intelligence exploded within the chipset, not the network.

## The Limits and Valley of Everyday Language

AI possesses PhD-level knowledge, yet its grasp of everyday empathy and context remains clumsy. Hallucinations occur more frequently in relationship-oriented conversations than in logical ones. This is a structural limitation of training data: text data teaches logic, but it does not teach the complexities of life.

## Counter-argument: Is 2025 Overhyped?

Some argue that scaling laws have hit a plateau. The exhaustion of high-quality data is a genuine threat. However, agentic workflows are compensating for these limitations. The key variable is now the efficient operation of systems rather than mere model performance. 2025 is a period of qualitative integration rather than quantitative expansion.

## FAQ

**Q: Why is 2025 considered a singularity?**  
A: It is the point where autonomous agents are being fully deployed into professional practical applications.

**Q: Has 5G failed completely?**  
A: It exists as a connectivity technology, but it has been sidelined from the center of innovation.

**Q: How should we utilize AI's STEM capabilities?**  
A: Delegate complex logic design and code verification tasks to AI.

## Conclusion and Call to Action

The technological landscape of 2025 differs significantly from what was imagined six years ago. Intelligent reasoning, rather than physical connectivity, is what changes the world. Establish LLM-based workflows immediately. Humans should focus on decision-making while delegating logical tasks to AI. The transformation is already complete.
