## TL;DR
- NVIDIA introduced the Cosmos Policy architecture to control robots using physical laws.
- This technology can reduce data costs while achieving high success rates in simulation.
- Developers should use these models to improve simulation efficiency before physical deployment.

Example: A mechanical hand tries to pick up several pieces of fruit from a container. When an item shifts unexpectedly, the fingers modify their grip strength and positions. The hand successfully places the object into a nearby container without any drops.

Robots are moving beyond simple command following toward understanding physical laws. The Cosmos Policy architecture allows flexible responses to uncertain environments. This transition mirrors the changes seen with Large Language Models.

## Current Status: Physical Intelligence Connecting Simulation to Reality
Physical AI models emerged around January 2026 to speed up robot development. Cosmos Policy helps robots manage complex manipulation and mobility. Traditional methods needed thousands of human-entered motions. This model internalizes physical laws to improve learning efficiency.

Success has been noted in specific figures. NVIDIA reports a 98.5% task success rate in simulation. Robots can now perceive and respond to environmental changes in real-time. These advancements support partners developing next-generation humanoids.

## Analysis: Balancing Cost Reduction and Hardware Limitations
The impact on data economics is significant. Real-world data collection costs may decrease by approximately 3.5 times. This allows smaller companies to develop high-performance control policies. Wide-scale robot intelligence may become more accessible.

Some challenges still exist. The 98.5% success rate comes from controlled simulations. Porting these results to complex industrial sites remains difficult. Predictions suggest walking robots in factories will remain under 5% as of 2025. Hardware durability might not match software intelligence speeds.

## Practical Application: Strategies for Utilizing the Cosmos Architecture
Developers should focus on replacing large data collection with quality simulation. Cosmos Policy shows performance even when demonstration data is scarce. Building virtual learning environments with this architecture is a primary task.

**Checklist for Today:**
- Identify robot tasks with low success rates to evaluate Cosmos Policy feasibility.
- Test learning speeds by combining small datasets with the Cosmos Policy model in simulation.
- Adjust the balance between complex manipulation and simple tasks based on hardware limits.

## FAQ
**Q: How does Cosmos Policy differ from existing robot control methods?**
A: Many existing methods were script-based and involved repetitive learning. Cosmos Policy uses models based on physical laws. It can determine plausible actions even in new environments.

**Q: Is this technology only applicable to humanoid robots?**
A: No. It applies to humanoids, mobile robots, and service robots.

**Q: Is the 98.5% simulation success rate expected in actual fields?**
A: This figure is a result from an optimized simulation environment. Actual fields involve variables like sensor errors and hardware wear. Developers should conduct a gradual validation phase using physical robots.

## Conclusion
Cosmos Policy provides a software foundation for physical robot interactions. Lower data costs and high success rates support humanoid commercialization. Future progress depends on software intelligence overcoming hardware constraints.
