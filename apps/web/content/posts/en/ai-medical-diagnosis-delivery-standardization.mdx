## TL;DR
- The HL7 FHIR standard and the 'Health and Medical Data Utilization Guidelines'.
Have been established as core indicators for the technical integration between AI diagnosis systems and pharmaceutical delivery services.
- Data standardization is an essential foundation for preventing the fragmentation of medical services and determining the pace of automation implementation.
However, potential risks exist regarding inconsistencies with logistics integration specifications.
- When implementing medical and automation solutions.
Organizations should verify support for RESTful API-based JSON/XML formats and evaluate data mapping capabilities according to HL7 FHIR specifications.

Example: Inside a quiet hospital, a machine generates prescription documents while an autonomous vehicle delivers items to the doorstep.

Instead of the noise of hospital waiting rooms, algorithms are issuing prescriptions and autonomous vehicles are delivering medications as these systems take concrete shape in practical applications. Generative AI is moving beyond diagnosis to integrate with physical logistics systems, entering a stage where end-to-end automation of medical, transportation, and education services is becoming a reality. The focus of this technology is shifting from the level of intelligence to the challenge of standardization—ensuring that disparate systems can exchange data seamlessly.

## Current Status
Industrial automation is evolving beyond individual function execution toward a model that integrates multiple sectors into a single data flow. In the medical field, a technical foundation has been established where results from AI diagnostic support systems are linked in real-time with pharmaceutical delivery systems. The 'Health and Medical Data Utilization Guidelines,' revised in December 2024, support this trend by providing standard definitions for Patient Generated Health Data (PGHD) and unstructured data.

At the center of this technical integration is the HL7 FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standard. Based on RESTful APIs and supporting both JSON and XML formats, this standard enables the real-time exchange of prescription information and patient data. This serves as the basis for moving away from closed medical data systems and building interfaces with external delivery services or AI collaboration tools.

However, uncertainty remains in the logistics integration—the final stage of pharmaceutical delivery. While healthcare data follows the FHIR standard, the APIs of delivery companies often adhere to general logistics industry standards. Maintaining security and consistency during the data transformation process between these two standards is a critical challenge in system implementation.

## Analysis
The introduction of AI automation systems simultaneously enhances both efficiency and complexity. Increasing the proportion of AI within medical systems is likely to reduce diagnostic errors and shorten patient wait times. However, this also presents security limitations, as sensitive health information could potentially leak into logistics networks outside the hospital.

Example: A user measures health metrics at home using a wearable device. If the system detects an abnormality, the AI converts the analysis results into FHIR-standard data and transmits it to the pharmacy and delivery system. The user receives the medication without leaving home, but during this process, data combining their movement route and health status is recorded on logistics servers.

These trade-offs also apply to transportation systems. While the introduction of autonomous vehicles and AI collaboration tools makes work environments more flexible, issues such as liability in the event of system failure or service disruptions due to a lack of data standards remain tasks to be solved. The success of technology adoption depends less on AI performance itself and more on how appropriately standard specifications, such as the December 2024 guidelines, are applied to the system.

## Practical Application
Developers and service planners should focus on interoperability beyond AI modeling. The following should be considered when building systems:

All data exchanges should be defined as FHIR resources within a RESTful API environment. This reduces redundant development costs during future platform integrations. Furthermore, when handling PGHD, legal risks should be managed by complying with the standard definitions in the guidelines revised in December 2024.

**To-Do List for Today:**
- Draft a mapping report to check whether internal data schemas are compatible with HL7 FHIR resource items.
- Verify if the APIs of integrated delivery partners support HTTPS-based secure authentication and JSON format.
- Reflect the core data items from the 'Health and Medical Data Utilization Guidelines' (revised in December 2024) into the system log design.

## FAQ
**Q: Why is the HL7 FHIR standard important in medical AI integration?**
A: Since FHIR is based on web technologies, it is well-suited for integration with modern AI services. Its granular data structure allows for the selective transmission of necessary information, making it a prerequisite for AI automation systems that should process large-scale medical data.

**Q: What problems arise if logistics API standards differ during pharmaceutical delivery?**
A: Standardized medical data may not be transmitted accurately to logistics systems. In such cases, middleware is required to convert the data, which can lead to data loss or delays, necessitating additional verification systems.

**Q: What are the key takeaways from the guidelines revised in December 2024?**
A: The focus is on the standardization of unstructured data and PGHD. Standards have been established to treat data collected from devices like smartwatches as reliable information within the medical system, which serves as a catalyst for expanding the data scope of AI diagnostic services.

## Conclusion
AI-based industrial automation is establishing a data ecosystem that connects healthcare, logistics, and transportation. Technical standards like HL7 FHIR and government guidelines serve as the blueprints that enable these connections.

Moving forward, technical solutions at the intersection of medical standards and general industrial standards will become increasingly important. Companies should continue to invest in the standardization of data interfaces and the enhancement of security alongside the advancement of AI algorithms.
