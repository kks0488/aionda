NVIDIA unveiled its next-generation AI chip architecture, "Blackwell," this past March. This chip features 208 billion transistors on a single GPU and delivers up to 30 times faster data processing speeds compared to the previous H100.

## Why It Matters
The core objective is to reduce the cost of training Large Language Models (LLMs). Blackwell reduces energy consumption by up to 25 times compared to the previous generation and achieves 20 petaflops of FP4 computing performance. According to the [NVIDIA Official Announcement](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-blackwell-platform-arrives-to-power-a-new-era-of-computing), operational efficiency is the central goal of its design.

This architecture is an attempt to address power density issues within data centers. NVIDIA has also significantly improved the performance of switches that interconnect tens of thousands of GPUs, enabling enterprises to operate large-scale AI models with significantly less energy.

## Background
Last year, the H100 chip experienced a global shortage. NVIDIA currently commands over 80% of the AI accelerator market. While competitors are working to close the gap in hardware and software integration, NVIDIA now plans to release a new architecture every year.

Securing a stable supply chain has been the primary challenge for AI companies. Meta and Microsoft have already pre-ordered hundreds of thousands of units. Blackwell is the strategic response to satisfy this massive demand.

## Outlook
Major cloud service providers, including AWS and Google, have confirmed the adoption of the new chips. Mass production and shipping are scheduled to begin in earnest during the second half of this year. Moving forward, the physical power supply constraints of data centers remain a key variable.
