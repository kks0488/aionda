More than a decade after software began "eating the world," OpenAI, the leader in artificial intelligence (AI), is turning its attention back to the realm of "iron and oil." To break through the limitations of algorithms, the next battlefield they have chosen is not the virtual world, but the vast manufacturing heartlands of the United States.

In January 2026, OpenAI announced a new Request for Proposal (RFP) centered on expanding AI infrastructure and accelerating manufacturing within the U.S. This move is a declaration of intent to internalize the entire hardware supply chain, going beyond mere equipment procurement. As the intelligence of AI models grows, the importance of the physical hardware supporting them increases, leading OpenAI to seek direct control over the very roots of the supply chain.

## The Blueprint for AI's Physical Form: Key Elements of the RFP

The RFP released by OpenAI is built upon three main pillars: data center infrastructure, consumer electronics, and robotics. This suggests that OpenAI is evolving from a chatbot developer into an "end-to-end AI company" that integrates hardware and software.

In the data center sector, power and cooling systems—including server racks, cabling, and networking equipment—have emerged as core challenges. Notably, the RFP specifies advanced cooling solutions such as chillers and cold plates. This is because the ability to manage the immense heat generated during high-performance AI computations directly correlates with AI performance.

A more intriguing aspect is the robotics and consumer electronics sections. OpenAI is requesting U.S.-based assembly processes for core components that serve as the "joints and muscles" of robots, such as gearboxes, motors, and control electronics. This signals that AI, which previously focused on generating text and images, is now preparing to enter the human physical world with a tangible body.

The timeline for this RFP is specific. The deadline for proposal submission is June 2026, with the final partner selection scheduled for March 2027. Through this process, OpenAI intends to expand the manufacturing base within the U.S., aiming to simultaneously ensure the stability of the AI ecosystem and promote job creation.

## A Declaration of 'Supply Chain Sovereignty' Beyond Simple Localization

OpenAI's current strategy differs from the paths taken by existing Big Tech companies like Google and Amazon. While established firms have primarily focused on developing "proprietary chips" optimized for their own clouds, OpenAI seeks to rebuild the entire physical stack—from data center cooling units to individual robot motors—within the United States.

This "U.S. re-industrialization" strategy is expected to lower the procurement costs of AI computational resources in the mid-to-long term. By reducing overseas dependence, the company can mitigate geopolitical risks and alleviate price volatility by minimizing the impact of tariffs. Furthermore, shortening the lead time for core components could drastically accelerate the expansion of AI infrastructure.

However, the future is not without challenges. Manufacturing costs in the U.S. remain high compared to Asia, and securing a skilled manufacturing workforce in a short period is a significant hurdle. Additionally, the relationship with its long-term partner, Microsoft (MS) Azure infrastructure, may become ambiguous. A key point of observation will be whether cracks form in existing partnerships or if new synergies emerge as OpenAI increases the proportion of its own infrastructure.

## Opportunities for Hardware Startups and Manufacturers

For hardware companies with a U.S. manufacturing base, this RFP represents a massive door of opportunity. Beyond securing a high-profile client like OpenAI, they can collaborate on establishing the standards for next-generation AI hardware.

Developers and hardware engineers must now focus on "AI-friendly design." The demand is not just for high-performance hardware, but for modular infrastructure design capabilities that can organically integrate with OpenAI’s Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal systems. In particular, component manufacturers in the robotics field must accelerate the development of high-precision motors and controllers optimized for OpenAI's control algorithms.

## FAQ: What You Need to Know About OpenAI's Infrastructure Strategy

**Q: What are the most noteworthy hardware elements in this RFP?**
**A:** They are the power and cooling systems for data centers (chillers, cold plates) and core components for robotics (gearboxes, motors). OpenAI is prioritizing energy efficiency and precision control to overcome the physical limitations of AI.

**Q: Will this strategy affect general users or service pricing?**
**A:** While infrastructure investment costs will be incurred in the short term, the internalization of the supply chain is expected to reduce computational costs in the mid-to-long term. This is highly likely to lead to the provision of more affordable and faster AI services.

**Q: What is the decisive difference compared to other Big Tech companies?**
**A:** Beyond vertical integration centered on cloud and software, OpenAI is attempting to build a foundation within the U.S. starting from the manufacturing processes and physical component stages. This reflects an ambition to become a core pillar of national manufacturing infrastructure, moving beyond being just a technology company.

## Conclusion: Writing the Future of AI with Steel, Not Just Code

OpenAI's RFP announcement signifies that the front line of the AI war has shifted from software code to factory lines. Their attempt to secure supply chain sovereignty by strengthening the U.S. manufacturing base will completely reshape the landscape of the AI industry over the next decade. By March 2027, when the final partners are selected, we may enter the era of "executing machines" rather than just "thinking machines." What we must pay attention to now is not just the number of model parameters, but where and how the server racks running those models are built.
