## TL;DR

- **What changed / what this is:** Commercial AI in defense contexts can involve controls beyond API use, including logs and configuration control.  
- **Why it matters:** DFARS 252.204-7012 cites incident duties, including retaining certain data for at least 90 days.  
- **What you should do next:** Define logs, retention scope, and change approvals in contracts and runbooks before adoption.

A commercial AI system can become subject to contract controls once it is used in operations.  
DFARS 252.204-7012 includes a “minimum 90-day retention” duty in incident contexts.  
That duty can affect contracts, runbooks, and product design.  
Questions then shift toward what data entered, what tools ran, and who can audit later.  
These questions can become security-control and procurement issues.  

The dispute concerns broader access and control requirements beyond simple API calls.  
Those requirements may cover operations, audit, and incident response.  
The technical stack alone may not settle the dispute.  
Procurement rules and compliance frameworks often shape the outcome.  

Example: A team uses a commercial AI with automated tools for internal work. After an incident, they struggle to explain decisions. Procurement asks for records and access controls. Engineering adds a review workflow.

## Current state

In defense procurement, the focus is often handling sensitive data like CUI.  
Incident-response obligations also matter.  
DFARS 252.204-7012 addresses contractors handling CUI and related security requirements.  
In a cyber incident, it cites retaining and protecting affected system images.  
It also cites retaining relevant monitoring and packet-capture data for at least 90 days.  
If requested by DoD, it can require additional information or equipment access for forensics.  

Logging and access control often appear as documented operational requirements.  
FedRAMP KSI (Moderate-level documentation) says you should continuously review or audit logs.  
It also says you should maintain a list of event types to monitor, log, and audit.  
It also points toward limiting access to log data with least privilege.  
It references role-based or attribute-based controls and just-in-time methods.  
The emphasis is not only generating logs.  
It also includes documenting what is logged and who can view it.  
It also includes defining the authority for log access.  

Supply-chain risk considerations can move in parallel.  
NIST SP 800-161 Rev.1 says relationships with external providers should use agreements or contracts.  
It says C‑SCRM processes and controls should be selected using criticality and risk assessments.  
It also mentions cost and benefit analyses.  
It also notes feasibility and cost-effectiveness as considerations.  
Requirements can be extended upstream when justified.  
That translation often happens through contract clauses.

## Analysis

“Access” often splits into several operational categories.  
A single permission rarely captures the full reality.  
A practical breakdown includes four buckets.  

1) **Data-path control** (what remains in training, logs, or cache)  
2) **Logging & audit** (what events are captured and who validates them)  
3) **Change management / configuration management** (how models, prompts, tools, and policies change)  
4) **Incident response** (what is retained, for how long, and provided to whom)  

DFARS 252.204-7012 can turn incident response into a contractual duty.  
It includes minimum 90-day retention for certain incident-related data.  
It can also include providing additional information or equipment access for forensics.  
FedRAMP KSI centers on event-type lists, log auditing, and least privilege.  
Those points primarily map to logging and audit.  
They also connect to data-path and change management decisions.  
Commercial AI can therefore face controls similar to IT or cloud procurement.  

Supply-chain-risk-driven requirements can also add burden.  
NIST SP 800-161 Rev.1 notes feasibility and cost-effectiveness as decision factors.  
Deeper audit or access requirements can raise vendor disclosure concerns.  
They can also drive redesign of logging, key management, or tenant isolation.  
They can increase the attack surface if access expands.  
They can also affect competition by narrowing eligible vendors.  
Scope decomposition can help reduce lock-in risk.  
Explicit rationale can also help during negotiations.

## Practical application

Agent-style automated execution can increase control risk in high-risk missions.  
Least privilege can apply to human accounts and process or tool privileges.  
NIST SP 800-53 AC-6 describes least privilege as allowing access when required for duties.  
The NIST AI RMF points toward defined and documented human oversight processes.  
It also points toward testing and validation before deployment and during operations.  
Independent review can be considered when appropriate.  
Teams can treat auditability and approval gates as product requirements.  
They can treat them alongside model performance requirements.  

Example: A team enables an automated execution connection for convenience. Execution happens without clear oversight. A later issue lacks a clear decision trail. The team adds approvals and reduces privileges.  

**Checklist for Today:**
- Document the event-type list and log access permissions, and align them with FedRAMP KSI guidance.  
- Specify DFARS 252.204-7012 incident duties in contracts and runbooks, including at least 90 days retention scope.  
- Split access and audit requirements by risk and cost, using NIST SP 800-161 Rev.1 feasibility considerations.

## FAQ

**Q1. Does “full access” mean disclosing source code or exposing model internals?**  
A. The cited requirements do not clearly state that model internals disclosure is required.  
DFARS 252.204-7012 can require additional information or equipment access for forensics.  
FedRAMP KSI focuses on operational controls for logs, event types, and access control.  
Contract-specific access boundaries typically need verification and negotiation.  

**Q2. How long should audit logs be retained?**  
A. DFARS 252.204-7012 cites at least 90 days retention in an incident-response context.  
It references system images and monitoring or packet-capture data.  
This text does not provide another numeric retention period for general audit logs.  
Organizations can set other durations through policy and contract terms.  

**Q3. Can the government force requirements upstream based on supply-chain risk?**  
A. NIST SP 800-161 Rev.1 says requirements can be extended upstream when needed.  
It also says feasibility and cost-effectiveness should be considered.  
That framing does not clearly support unlimited expansion of requirements.  
A risk-based scope and rationale can support negotiations.
