## TL;DR
- eBay is banning access for AI "buy for me" tools that have not received platform approval.
- The platform demands transparency and clear accountability for agents performing autonomous commerce.
- This policy is part of a broader effort to strengthen platform management against security threats and market distortion caused by the proliferation of AI.

Example.
A program operating behind the scenes scans thousands of listings at once and confirms purchases at a speed hard for humans to match.

As AI agents begin to complete transactions without human intervention, discussions regarding who bears responsibility for these purchases have become necessary. The emergence of agents that autonomously browse the web and proceed to payment is significantly impacting commerce. In response to this trend, eBay has introduced a policy that restricts unauthorized automated payments and proxy purchasing agents, making prior approval mandatory. This serves as a primary case study of how platforms will manage AI-driven economic activities.

## Current Status
eBay recently updated its operating policies to control the increasing activity of AI agents. The core of the change is that AI tools with "buy for me" functionality should obtain prior approval to access the platform. eBay has restricted unauthorized automated shopping behaviors and strengthened technical and policy mechanisms to block them.

These regulations represent a step forward from previous bot-blocking policies. The intent is for the platform to exercise direct control over AI that moves beyond simple information gathering to perform the act of payment. eBay is currently establishing procedures to verify whether agents have legitimate authorization and whether their actions align with the user's intent.

## Analysis
eBay's decision highlights the management chaos arising during the transition to an agent-centric web environment. When agents shop on behalf of users, platforms face server loads from traffic surges and issues regarding transaction validity. If a refund is requested for an item purchased by an AI by mistake, legal and ethical debates may arise regarding whether the responsibility lies with the user, the developer, or the platform.

Furthermore, autonomous commerce agents pose a risk to market fairness. AI agents could monopolize limited-edition products or secure inventory at speeds inaccessible to regular users. By enforcing a prior approval system, eBay aims to force transparency regarding the identity of these agents, thereby reducing transactions where accountability is unclear. This policy is likely to become a benchmark for how other commerce platforms manage AI agents in the future.

## Practical Application
Agent developers and users should find ways to operate within the modified regulations. Developers should provide agent information through eBay's official API and comply with security and transparency guidelines. Users should verify whether the tools they use have received formal approval from the platform.

**Checklist for Today:**
- Check service announcements to see if the AI shopping assistants you currently use comply with eBay's new policy.
- Enable payment limit settings to prepare for potential accidental payments by AI agents.
- If you are developing an automated purchasing tool, review the agent registration and approval process via the eBay Developers Program portal.

## FAQ
**Q: Are AI chatbots that simply compare prices also subject to the ban?**
A: The focus is on actions that intervene in actual transactions, such as proxy purchasing or automated payments, rather than information gathering itself. However, unauthorized data collection may still be restricted under existing policies, so verification is required.

**Q: What conditions are required to receive approval for an AI agent?**
A: eBay uses transparency, security, and whether explicit user consent has been obtained as key criteria. Specifically, the agent should be verified to ensure it does not interfere with platform operations and upholds fair trading standards.

**Q: Will this policy hinder the development of AI technology?**
A: While it may act as a constraint for developers in the short term, it helps build a responsible ecosystem in the long run. By distinguishing between illegitimate bots and legitimate services, it can support the healthy growth of the AI agent industry.

## Conclusion
eBay's policy change is a responsive measure to the rise of autonomous AI as an economic actor. Moving forward, the key issue in commerce will not only be who purchased an item, but which agent made the decision and how. We have reached a point where we should consider the responsibility and transparency hidden behind the convenience offered by AI agents.
