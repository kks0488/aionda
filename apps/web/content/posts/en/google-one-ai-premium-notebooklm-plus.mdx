## TL;DR
- **Core Issue**.
Google has integrated NotebookLM Plus features into the Google One AI Premium plan, offering higher usage limits and management capabilities compared to standard plans.
- **Significance**.
As the value of AI tools is quantified by processing capacity and task frequency beyond simple access, calculating cost efficiency has become crucial for professional users.
- **Reader Action**: Evaluate your source management scale and daily query frequency.
Consider upgrading your plan if bottlenecks are expected due to usage limits.

Example: A user registering multiple reference documents for a voluminous report hits the source registration limit and stops working. Forced to delete existing materials or abandon new projects, the user experiences the productivity gap based on subscription tiers.

## Current Status


## Analysis
This policy change indicates that AI monetization strategies are shifting from model performance competition to infrastructure occupancy competition. While standard Premium plans primarily focus on securing storage space, AI Premium users are essentially purchasing intelligent bandwidth for information processing and refinement. Relaxing usage limits reduces the cognitive cost associated with selecting and deleting sources during complex projects.

However, a challenge remains for standard Premium users who find their AI feature limits identical to those of free users despite paying for a subscription. Furthermore, as some information regarding specific high-tier plans or the exact criteria for text units per source remains ambiguous, users requiring precise data processing should exercise caution.

## Practical Application
Individual researchers and data analysts should choose a plan based on their current work patterns. While a standard Premium plan may suffice for basic model experimentation, the expanded limits of AI Premium may be necessary for those needing to structure hundreds of papers or reports.

**Actions to take today:**
- Check the current number of notebooks in NotebookLM and the average number of sources within each notebook.
- Measure if your workflow is interrupted by approaching the 50-query limit per day.
- Verify if the limit of 500,000 words per source accommodates the size of your primary documents during large-scale summarization.

## FAQ
**Q: Can I subscribe to NotebookLM Plus features separately from the standard Premium plan?**

**Q: Do the higher usage limits of the AI Premium plan apply to all features?**
A: These figures are specific criteria for NotebookLM’s notebook creation, source registration, daily queries, and audio generation. Availability limits for other services may differ.

**Q: Is the limit of 500,000 words per source an exact standard?**
A: While it is stated in word units, differences may occur in conversion methods across languages or specific token limits depending on the usage environment, so further verification is required.

## Conclusion
Google's subscription structure is trending toward a separation between data storage and data processing. AI Premium plans, including NotebookLM Plus, can serve as a practical incentive for knowledge workers handling large volumes of information. It is worth watching how these tiered usage policies will shape the gap in user experience in the future.
