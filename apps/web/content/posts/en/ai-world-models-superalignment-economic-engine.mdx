We currently stand at a peculiar juncture where the fear of technology displacing human jobs clashes with the hope that it will rescue humanity from eternal poverty. While the public envisions a Terminator-esque dystopian future, a completely different scenario is being written in the heart of Silicon Valley. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is evolving beyond mere chatbots into a "deflation engine" designed to break down the massive economic barriers of low growth and inflation.

## World Models and Superalignment: A New Architecture of Intelligence

The greatest weakness of modern AI is that it "speaks without thinking." Yann LeCun, Chief AI Scientist at Meta, directly criticizes the limitations of current Large Language Models (LLMs). He asserts that human-level intelligence cannot be reached simply by predicting the next word, proposing the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) based on "World Models" as an alternative.

Instead of navigating the sea of text data, JEPA directly learns physical causality within an abstract latent space. This means AI can understand the laws of physics in the real world and perform logical reasoning. Consequently, it suppresses hallucinations, significantly reduces training energy consumption, and drastically lowers the social monitoring costs caused by malfunctions.

Simultaneously, Ilya Sutskever is staking everything on securing control over superintelligence. The "Superalignment" he proposed is a technical answer to how humans can tame AI that is smarter than themselves. Through a "Scalable Oversight" system, he enables AI to monitor and evaluate other AI systems. It is a mechanism to technically align intelligence that evolves at a pace humans cannot comprehend, ensuring the technological singularity becomes a substantial asset rather than a catastrophe for humanity.

## AI Optimism Proven by Numbers: The Magic of 0.9%

These technical advancements do not stop at engineering achievements; they redesign macroeconomic indicators. Recent research data from the OECD and IMF numerically prove the economic prosperity AI will bring. The OECD predicts that AI adoption will boost labor productivity by approximately 0.4 to 0.9 percentage points annually. This is a powerful figure that could instantly reverse the global trend of low growth.

AI dramatically expands aggregate supply, which directly leads to price stability. The BIS (Bank for International Settlements) analyzed that AI will trigger a "disinflationary" effect by lowering production costs and easing inflationary pressures. In high-skilled sectors, real wage increases through technical complementarity are already being observed. While shadows like wage stagnation in occupations with high automation risks exist, there is a consensus that the size of the overall economic pie will grow.

## Analysis: Changes in Asset Structure Brought by the Democratization of Intelligence

While we worry that technology will undermine the value of labor, the real point of focus should be the "zero marginal cost of intelligence." Throughout human history, intelligence has always been a scarce resource and, therefore, expensive. However, once Yann LeCun's "Objective-Driven AI" is perfected, intelligence will become a cheap and universal infrastructure like electricity or water.

From a critical perspective, the key lies in how to overcome the "time-lag" where productivity gains transition into actual wages. If technology creates a structure that only benefits capitalists, social consensus will collapse. Furthermore, the massive demand for capital to invest in AI could drive up interest rates in the short term, potentially offsetting the price stability effects. Nevertheless, AI that understands the physical world will change the paradigm of manufacturing through its integration with robotics, forcing a restructuring of individual asset portfolios from "labor income" to "technical ownership."

## Practical Application: How to Prepare for the AI Economic Era

Entrepreneurs, developers, and individual investors must now bet on "reasoning" beyond "generation." They must move beyond simple text summarization and preemptively adopt "World Model"-based solutions that can solve complex business logic through physical causality.

1. **Establish Agentic Workflows**: Instead of just using chatbots, embed workflows into your organization where AI sets plans and executes them autonomously once an objective is defined.
2. **Data-ify Intellectual Assets**: Securing unique domain data that AI can learn from will become your future dividends.
3. **Enhance Tech-Complementary Capabilities**: Occupy a position as an "AI instructor" who manages AI as a tool by focusing on "complex problem solving" and "human value judgment"—areas that AI struggles to replace.

## FAQ

**Q: Even if AI increases productivity, won't my salary decrease?**
A: Looking at the history of the Industrial Revolution, short-term job transition pain is unavoidable. However, AI tends to complement rather than replace labor. According to IMF analysis, real wages for occupations that use AI to create higher added value are expected to rise.

**Q: When will Yann LeCun's World Model be commercialized?**
A: LeCun predicts that a new architecture surpassing the limits of current LLMs will emerge within the next five years, integrated with robotics. Early models like V-JEPA have already been released as open-source, proving the potential.

**Q: What use is economic prosperity if superintelligence is out of human control?**
A: That is precisely why Ilya Sutskever is obsessed with Superalignment. Before reaching the technological singularity, "alignment technology"—ensuring AI aligns with human values—is the top priority in AI research. Intelligence without guaranteed safety cannot be valued in the market.

## Conclusion

AI optimism is not groundless. It is a sophisticated future strategy combining Yann LeCun's physical intelligence, Ilya Sutskever's safe superintelligence, and the supporting macroeconomic data. We must now adapt to an era of abundance brought by an excess of intelligence rather than its scarcity. Our focus moving forward should not be on what AI can do, but on the ethical and economic choices regarding the purposes for which humanity will use this infinite intelligence.
