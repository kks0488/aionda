xAI has unexpectedly revealed a new suspected model of 'Grok.' This model outperforms the initial leaked version that appeared a few days ago. Initial benchmark results show that it has reached the performance levels of Gemini 3 Pro and Claude 4.5 Opus.

## Why This News Matters
This model suggests that xAI’s technical capabilities have passed a critical threshold. They have moved beyond being a mere follower and have entered the top tier of the industry. Performance data currently reflects State-of-the-Art (SOTA) rankings.

The model's reasoning capabilities have seen a significant leap, proving the efficiency of its training on large-scale datasets. It is now positioned to compete directly with next-generation models from Google and Anthropic.

## Background
Estimates for the previous model, 'Grok 4.20,' fell short of expectations. At that time, the model exhibited limitations in general-purpose performance. However, this new model has secured high scores in the domains of coding and mathematics.

User verification is ongoing on platforms such as the [LMSYS Chatbot Arena](https://chat.lmsys.org/). Early testers highly rate the accuracy of the responses, which is being interpreted as a result of xAI's intensive allocation of computing resources.

## Outlook
Competition at the forefront of the AI market is expected to intensify further. xAI is likely to integrate this model into the X (formerly Twitter) service immediately. The industry is now focused on the timing of OpenAI’s response.
