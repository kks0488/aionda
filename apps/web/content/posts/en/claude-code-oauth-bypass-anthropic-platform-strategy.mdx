# The Boundary of Claude Code: OAuth Token Bypass and Anthropic's Platform Strategy

Anthropic's Claude Code was launched as a tool specialized for developers, but there are clear technical limitations in using its OAuth tokens for API calls that distinguish it from the general Claude API. Some developers attempt to bypass these restrictions through methods like OpenCode, which raises not just a technical experiment but also questions about the strategic boundary-setting by AI service providers and developer ethics simultaneously. Understanding why Anthropic strictly restricts the use of the Claude Code brand and the implications of attempts to break through these restrictions is key to grasping the evolutionary direction of generative AI platforms.

## Current Status: Investigated Facts and Data

The Claude Code OAuth token targets individual users based on Claude Pro or Claude Max subscriptions. This token is issued via the OAuth 2.0 PKCE flow and must be used with specific beta endpoint parameters alongside the 'Authorization: Bearer' header for API calls. This shows a distinct technical difference from the pay-as-you-go general Claude API key, which calls standard REST endpoints using the 'x-api-key' header. Anthropic's official documentation specifies Claude Code as a personal interface for integrating with agents and tools.

Anthropic's Terms of Service and Branding Guidelines impose strict restrictions on the use of the 'Claude Code' name. Third-party services cannot use any name that could be mistaken for Claude Code or an official Anthropic product and must maintain their own independent branding. Regarding commercial activities, the resale of service access rights, profit-making activities through account sharing, and the use of Claude Code to develop AI models or services that compete with Anthropic are explicitly prohibited.

## Analysis: Meaning and Impact

This technical separation and policy restriction reflect Anthropic's intended service segmentation strategy. Claude Code focuses on a subscription-based, personalized coding assistant experience, while the general API is a business-centric product offering flexible programmatic integration and scalability. As seen in the OpenCode case, attempts to use the Claude Code OAuth token to bypass traffic aggregation or circumvent the terms of service are essentially efforts to break down this strategic boundary. Developers seek to retain the benefits of Claude Code (e.g., subscription-based predictable costs) while also gaining the broad applicability of the Claude API.

Anthropic's strong control over the use of 'Code' derivative service names goes beyond simple brand protection; it is to clearly define service positioning and competitive dynamics in the market. Through this, Anthropic clarifies that while Claude is a general conversational AI, Claude Code is a product specialized for specific professional tasks (coding). This separation also helps manage user expectations and differentiate long-term monetization paths (subscription vs. pay-as-you-go).

## Practical Application: Methods Readers Can Utilize

Developers should primarily consider the integration methods officially recommended by Anthropic. For example, to connect Claude Code with external tools, Anthropic suggests integrating via Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. MCP servers can be added with project-specific scope using the `claude mcp add` command or configuration files. This method enhances context efficiency by loading only the necessary tools on-demand in a secure local environment through a standardized protocol.

If you wish to integrate Claude Code into a commercial service, it is essential to carefully review Anthropic's terms and comply with the branding guidelines. Use your own independent service name and avoid confusion with Anthropic's official products. Rather than solutions that bypass technical restrictions, reviewing the usage terms and pricing policies of the official API product family (Claude API) and basing your service design on them is a sustainable approach.

## FAQ: 3 Questions

**Q: Can I call the general Claude API endpoint with a Claude Code OAuth token?**
A: According to official documentation, the Claude Code OAuth token is designed to be used with specific beta endpoints. It likely has a separate technical stack that is not compatible with the standard endpoints and 'x-api-key' header method of the general Claude API.

**Q: Can I use the name 'Code' for the coding assistant tool I developed?**
A: Anthropic's Branding Guidelines prohibit the use of names that could be mistaken for 'Claude Code' or an Anthropic product. While there is no explicit clause found regarding the use of the common word 'Code' itself, you must be especially careful to ensure that the overall service name and design do not cause confusion with Anthropic's products.

**Q: Is it allowed to share the OAuth token obtained through a Claude Code subscription with team members to create a collaboration tool?**
A: Anthropic's Commercial Terms of Service explicitly prohibit profit-making activities through account sharing. The appropriate official solution for team collaboration is to use Anthropic's Team or Enterprise plans.

## Conclusion: Summary + Actionable Suggestions

The technical and policy boundary between Claude Code and the Claude API is Anthropic's intended strategy. Developers should maximize the use of officially provided integration channels and tools (like MCP) rather than attempting short-term workarounds to bypass restrictions, and should align long-term service design with the conditions of the official API. A collaborative relationship with an AI platform can be built sustainably only on a foundation of clear understanding and compliance with the terms.
