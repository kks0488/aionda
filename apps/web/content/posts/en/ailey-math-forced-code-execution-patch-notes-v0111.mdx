Your AI is still failing at math. The Singularity Gallery has released a prompt that forces code execution. Using this tool, Gemini's CSAT math scores have improved significantly.

## What Happened
A dedicated prompt that forces "code execution" in Gemini has emerged. The "Ailey Math" tool utilizes Python code to correct calculation errors. It recorded a high accuracy rate in the common mathematics section of the CSAT (College Scholastic Ability Test). Users improve performance by inserting specific text into the default settings.

## Why It Matters
This provides a clue to solving the chronic calculation errors of Large Language Models (LLMs). Performance is now determined by tool-use capability rather than simple text generation. It presents practical standards for AI utilization for both students and developers.

## Background
Existing AI models have shown limitations in complex calculus operations. While Gemini’s fast mode is quick, its computational accuracy remains low. Developers have combined Python graph visualization with forced code execution. This method maximizes the model's logical reasoning capabilities.

## Future Outlook
AI will perform precise calculations beyond mere mathematical reasoning. It will be deployed to solve high-difficulty engineering problems, not just the CSAT. Prompt engineering will evolve into a more sophisticated form of tool control.

## FAQ
**Q: Where should I put the code?**
A: Paste the content into the TXT area of Gemini’s custom settings.

**Q: Does it solve all math problems?**
A: Limitations still exist for ultra-high-difficulty problems, such as Calculus Question 30.

**Q: Is the performance difference significant?**
A: There is a clear difference in the accuracy rate depending on whether Python code is executed.
