Jensen Huang took the stage in his signature leather jacket, but he wasn't just selling chips. He was preaching a new doctrine: the "economics of inference." While the star of CES 2026 was the next-generation architecture, 'Rubin,' the event revealed a massive strategic shift—NVIDIA is dismantling its closed fortress to dive into the sea of open models. NVIDIA is now evolving beyond a mere GPU manufacturer to become the architect of a global neural network, aiming to embed artificial intelligence (AI) into every object worldwide.

## Rubin Swallows Blackwell: Redefining the Speed of Inference

The Rubin platform, unveiled by NVIDIA, renders the success of its predecessor, Blackwell, a legacy of the past. Rubin adopts an "extreme co-design" approach, integrating six core chips while transitioning to a 3nm (nanometer) process. The numbers speak for themselves: Rubin delivers 50 PFLOPS (petaflops) of inference performance based on the NVFP4 data format—five times faster than Blackwell. Memory bandwidth has been expanded to 22TB/s by incorporating HBM4, the sixth generation of High Bandwidth Memory. This speed allows for the simultaneous processing of thousands of high-definition movies per second.

More surprising than the performance is the power efficiency. NVIDIA has improved energy efficiency at the system level by fivefold and reduced the cost per inference token by tenfold. However, behind this overwhelming performance lies a massive thirst for power. The power consumption of the 'NVL72' rack system, which links 72 Rubin chips, is estimated to exceed 250kW. Essentially, a single rack consumes as much power as an entire conventional data center. NVIDIA is testing the limits of the power grid in its pursuit of performance.

## From a Closed Fortress to a Champion of Open Ecosystems

Until now, NVIDIA has built a wall that competitors could not scale by bundling hardware with its software (CUDA). However, its actions at CES 2026 signal the opposite direction. The company released a slew of open AI models for key domains, such as Nemotron, Alpamayo, and Cosmos. This is a strategic move to counter the closed "black box" models led by Google and OpenAI, allowing anyone to freely modify and deploy models on NVIDIA chips.

The core of this strategy is not about targeting niche markets. Instead of having enterprises spend hundreds of billions of won to train models from scratch, NVIDIA encourages them to take its open models and fine-tune them with their own data. Ultimately, all roads lead to NVIDIA hardware and NIM (NVIDIA Inference Microservices). While competitors like AMD or Intel attempt to catch up in hardware performance, NVIDIA is preemptively securing the software ecosystem standard under the banner of "openness."

## Autonomous Driving: Can the Curse of the Long Tail Be Broken?

NVIDIA’s vision extends beyond the data center to the streets. The newly announced Alpamayo model family represents the pinnacle of "reasoning AI" for autonomous vehicles. While traditional autonomous driving relied on perceiving objects and making decisions based on predefined rules, it now reasons logically like a human. For instance, seeing a ball bounce into the road leads the AI to predict that "a child might be nearby."

However, technical challenges remain. The chronic issue of autonomous driving—the "long tail" (rare but critical exceptional scenarios)—cannot be solved by Rubin’s computational power alone. Latency occurring during real-time data processing and the opacity of AI decision-making still hit the wall of safety concerns. Actual data on how to manage the heat generated by the Rubin architecture within the confined space of a vehicle also remains under wraps.

## A New Grammar for Developers and Enterprises

Developers must now shift their focus from "which model to use" to "how to optimize." The emergence of the Rubin platform will accelerate the popularization of Agentic AI (AI that sets goals and executes them autonomously). Enterprises no longer need to rely solely on Large Language Models (LLMs). They can achieve instantaneous responses by embedding lightweight, Rubin-based open models into edge devices or autonomous robots.

The immediate priority is building workflows utilizing 'NIM.' Through these microservices provided by NVIDIA, structures must be created to extract 100% of Rubin's performance without complex infrastructure setups. In an era where hardware advancement outpaces software, the speed of adapting to tools defines competitiveness.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: What is the biggest difference between the Rubin architecture and Blackwell?**
A: It is the overwhelming improvement in memory bandwidth through process refinement (3nm) and the introduction of HBM4. Specifically, with a fivefold increase in inference performance, it delivers a level of performance for Agentic AI and autonomous driving—where real-time response is critical—that is on a different dimension compared to Blackwell.

**Q: What is the real reason NVIDIA is releasing open models?**
A: It is an ecosystem capture strategy to maximize hardware sales. By distributing open models that are more accessible than closed models, the goal is to make developers worldwide dependent on NVIDIA’s infrastructure (Rubin, CUDA, NIM).

**Q: What is the biggest challenge the Rubin platform must solve in the field of autonomous driving?**
A: It is the computational load and power consumption that occur during the transition to reasoning AI. Furthermore, the key to commercialization lies in how to verify the basis of AI's judgments and ensure safety in unpredictable, sudden situations on the road.

## Conclusion: From Chipmaker to AI Operating System

The NVIDIA Rubin platform is not just the arrival of faster semiconductors. It is an event that declares the "democratization of inference," ending the era of high-cost AI and allowing AI to permeate every industry. While challenges regarding power consumption and safety verification remain, Jensen Huang has already completed the blueprint for a massive "AI Empire" combining hardware and software. The industry's focus is no longer on how many Rubin units will be sold, but on how fundamentally the results produced by Rubin will change our daily lives. The redefinition of accelerated computing has already begun.
