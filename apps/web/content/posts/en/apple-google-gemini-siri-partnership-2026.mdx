Apple and Google announced a major AI partnership on January 12. Next-generation Siri and Apple Intelligence will run on Google's Gemini models. Apple will pay approximately $1 billion annually for this.

## Partnership Key Points

According to the joint statement from both companies, the next generation of Apple Foundation Models will be built on Google's Gemini models and cloud technology.

**Key Numbers:**
- **Investment**: Approximately $1 billion per year
- **Model Size**: 1.2 trillion parameters (8x larger than current Apple models)
- **Scope**: Siri, summarization features, planner, and more

Apple stated they "determined that Google's technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models after careful evaluation."

## Why Did Apple Choose Google?

Apple's AI strategy hasn't been smooth sailing.

**Background:**
- Siri upgrade announced in 2024 delayed to 2026
- Recognition of limitations in self-developed model (150B parameters)
- Criticism for lacking AI features compared to competitors

Google's Gemini is currently one of the most powerful multimodal AIs. For Apple, adopting proven technology was more rational than internal development.

## What About the Existing OpenAI Partnership?

Apple already integrates ChatGPT into Siri for complex queries. After the Google partnership announcement, attention turned to how this relationship would change.

Apple told CNBC that "there are no changes to the OpenAI agreement." This suggests different use cases.

| Partner | Use Case |
|---------|----------|
| Google Gemini | Core Siri functions, summarization, planner |
| OpenAI ChatGPT | Complex queries, general knowledge |

## What About Privacy?

Apple's core value of privacy is maintained.

According to the joint statement:
- Apple Intelligence continues to run on devices and Private Cloud Compute
- Maintains Apple's industry-leading privacy standards
- Sensitive data processing uses Apple's own models

Google is building a custom 1.2 trillion parameter model exclusively for Apple. Only some features go through Google servers; the rest is processed on-device.

## Market Reaction

Google's stock surged on this news.

- **Google Market Cap**: Briefly crossed $4 trillion intraday (4th company ever)
- Joins Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple in reaching this milestone

It's a win-win: Apple gains AI competitiveness, Google secures stable revenue.

## Release Timeline

Next-gen AI-enhanced Siri is scheduled for release within 2026.

**Expected Compatible Devices:**
- iPhone (iOS 26 and above)
- iPad
- Mac
- Apple Watch (limited features)

Exact release timing is undetermined, but detailed announcements are expected at WWDC 2026.

## FAQ

**Q: How will this differ from current Siri?**

A: Based on a 1.2 trillion parameter model, natural language understanding, context awareness, and complex request handling will improve significantly. Multi-step tasks and creative requests that current Siri struggles with will become possible.

**Q: Will my personal data be sent to Google?**

A: Apple emphasized maintaining privacy standards. Most processing occurs on-device or in Apple's Private Cloud, with only certain features utilizing Google servers.

**Q: Will OpenAI ChatGPT integration disappear?**

A: No. Apple stated there are no changes to the OpenAI agreement. Both partnerships will be maintained for different purposes.

## Conclusion

The Apple-Google AI partnership is a new model of big tech collaboration. Two competing companies joined hands facing the common challenge of AI.

Apple quickly closes its AI gap, Google gains $1 billion in stable annual revenue and a $4 trillion market cap. Users can also look forward to a smarter Siri.

However, long-term questions remain about Apple's own AI capabilities. Whether a structure where Siri's core depends on external technology is sustainable remains to be seen.
