# Welcome to Singularity Blog

This blog curates the best AI and technology discussions from Korea's **"Singularity is Coming"** (특이점이 온다) community on DC Inside.

## What We Do

1. **Crawl** - Automatically collect posts from the gallery
2. **Curate** - Manually select the most valuable content
3. **Verify** - Fact-check claims using AI and web search
4. **Translate** - Convert Korean content to English
5. **Publish** - Share verified insights globally

## Why This Exists

Korea's tech communities often discuss AI developments hours or days before they reach English-speaking audiences. We bridge that gap by:

- Translating breaking news and insights
- Verifying rumors before spreading them
- Adding context for non-Korean readers

## Verification Scores

Every post shows a **verification score** (0-100%):

- **90-100%**: Fully verified with official sources
- **70-89%**: Verified with reliable sources
- **50-69%**: Partially verified
- **Below 50%**: Needs additional verification

## Stay Updated

New posts are added regularly. Check back often for the latest AI insights from Korea!
