# Can DeepSeek-V4 Outperform Claude and GPT in Coding Benchmarks?

The competition among AI models is shifting to a specific battlefield: coding. With news that DeepSeek plans to unveil its next model, V4, just before the Lunar New Year holiday, roughly two months after the release of V3, the industry's model update cycle is poised to be redefined once more. More notably, by claiming superior coding performance against the Claude and GPT series in its own benchmarks, it signals that competition in specific domains is intensifying.

## Current Status: Investigated Facts and Data

DeepSeek-V4, set for an official technical report release in mid-February 2026, is revealing its outline through pre-released technical whitepapers and research papers. The model is described as adopting a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture with approximately 1 trillion parameters, while maintaining efficiency by activating only about 32 billion parameters per token. Although the official scale of the training data is unconfirmed, it is expected to exceed the 14.8 trillion tokens used by the previous V3 model.

The claims in the official documentation regarding performance improvements are clear. V4 reportedly introduces the 'mHC (Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections)' architecture, which replaces V3's residual connection structure, solving numerical instability during large-scale scaling. According to the technical whitepaper, completeness in solving LeetCode Hard problems improved by 40% compared to V3, and error backtracing frequency decreased by 62%. If these claims hold true, it signifies a significant improvement in reasoning stability and accuracy for coding tasks.

The release of public benchmark results has become standard practice for major models. For example, Claude Opus 4.5 Sonnet officially announced a score of 92.0% on HumanEval, while OpenAI o1-mini reported 92.4%. DeepSeek also made its competitive stance clear by announcing a high score of 94.1% for V3 at its release. Although the official performance figures for V4 are not yet public, these historical records show the high baseline the new model must surpass.

## Analysis: Implications and Impact

DeepSeek's rapid iteration cycle demonstrates the maturation phase of the generative AI market. It's a strategic move beyond simple scaling to secure differentiated advantage in a specific domain (coding, in this case). Technological innovations like the MoE architecture and mHC are extensions of efforts to operate larger models more efficiently and stably. This suggests that the focus of AI development is shifting from the 'largest model' to the 'most useful model'.

The focus on coding performance is both a market strategy and a practical judgment. Software development is a field where the productivity enhancement effects of AI tools are directly measurable, and it can secure an early adopter base of engineers. DeepSeek's claim of superiority over Claude and GPT in its own benchmarks is a clear positioning to highlight its strengths against established large language models. However, the validity of these claims must be verified through independent third-party benchmarks and real user experience.

## Practical Application: Methods Readers Can Utilize

Developers and tech leaders should perceive this release not just as news, but as a signal of changing tool landscapes. Metrics claimed by the new model, such as the 40% improvement in LeetCode Hard problem-solving completeness, can serve as a gauge for its actual support capability in high-difficulty tasks like complex algorithm design or legacy code refactoring.

When considering actual adoption, it's advisable to conduct evaluations using real business logic or internal company codebases alongside standard benchmarks like HumanEval and MBPP as soon as the official report is released. Particularly, the reduction in error backtracing frequency is a factor that can directly impact the reliability and usefulness of an AI assistant during long coding sessions. Evaluation should be based on performance and stability in one's primary use cases, rather than just parameter scale or architecture.

## FAQ

**Q: When exactly will DeepSeek-V4 be released?**
A: The official release is scheduled for mid-February 2026, around the Lunar New Year (Spring Festival) holiday. Current public information is based on a pre-release technical whitepaper (v0.9b) and research papers.

**Q: Using a 1-trillion parameter model seems like it would require enormous computing resources.**
A: DeepSeek-V4 adopts an MoE architecture, activating only about 32 billion parameters per token (approximately 3%) out of the total 1 trillion parameters. This is a design that enables relatively efficient inference compared to its full scale.

**Q: Can we trust real coding performance based solely on public benchmark results?**
A: While public benchmarks like HumanEval and MBPP are standardized comparison metrics, they are results from each company's own testing environment. For a final judgment, we recommend independent verification and testing by integrating it into your actual workflow.

## Conclusion

The announced release of DeepSeek-V4 shows that the focus of AI model competition is shifting from generality to specialized capabilities. The rapid development cycle and aggressive claims about coding performance are one aspect of the differentiation war occurring as the market enters maturity. For tech leaders and developers, it's time to evaluate this new tool based on the stability improvements brought by the new architecture and its usefulness in their specific use cases, rather than just promotional figures.
