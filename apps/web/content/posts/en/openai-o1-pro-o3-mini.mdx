Can't we catch both the best performance and the best cost-effectiveness? (Problem)
In mid-2025, OpenAI targeted the market by bifurcating its Reasoning model lineup into **o1-pro** and **o3-mini**. (Solution)
Now developers can achieve optimal efficiency by selecting `o1-pro` for heavy scientific research and `o3-mini` for fast and repetitive coding tasks. (Evidence)

## o1-pro: Uncompromising Intelligence
`o1-pro` thinks deeper using more computational resources than the existing o1 model.
- **Use Cases**: High-risk tasks where the 'correct answer' is crucial, such as drug discovery, complex legal analysis, and quantum physics simulation.
- **Features**: Hallucinations are extremely suppressed, and there are almost no logical leaps.

## o3-mini: Balance of Speed and Intelligence
`o3-mini` is a small model specialized for science, math, and coding tasks.
- **Advantages**: Very fast and cheap. However, its reasoning capability exceeds the existing GPT 5.2 class.
- **Usage**: Real-time code autocompletion, math tutoring bots, data preprocessing agents.

## Strategic Selection Guide
- **Cost irrelevant, 100% accuracy goal** -> `o1-pro`
- **Large traffic, fast response, decent reasoning** -> `o3-mini`
- **General conversation and multipurpose** -> `GPT 5.2.1`

OpenAI's portfolio is now ready to satisfy all needs.
