# The Hidden Code of Humanity: How Free Are We?

Do our choices stem from true free will, or are they merely the execution of values pre-coded by biology and society? This question has now moved beyond the realm of philosophy and is being explored empirically through neuroscience and artificial intelligence research. Social behavioral patterns, such as innate views on marriage, can be likened to 'biological/social coding,' and a perspective has been proposed that free will is acquired through the process of recognizing and circumventing these coded values.

## Current Status: Investigated Facts and Data

Research in neuroscience and behavioral economics shows that 'innate code' is deeply involved in human decision-making. This code refers to instinctual mechanisms and biases imprinted on the brain for evolutionary survival. Behavioral economist Daniel Kahneman defined this as 'System 1'—an intuitive system that proves humans rely on heuristics and biases rather than logic. Studies by neuroscientists like Robert Sapolsky explain that neural circuits centered on the limbic system, such as the amygdala, operate ancient survival algorithms even in modern, complex social choice situations, leading to irrational decisions.

On the other hand, large-scale sociological data using specific variables like 'degree of awareness of innate views on marriage' has not been confirmed. However, small-scale studies in the fields of Catholic theology and pastoral counseling suggest that awareness of the innate nature of marriage may affect marital satisfaction. In general sociology, this is sometimes classified as 'traditional views on marriage' or 'sacramental views on marriage,' analyzing their positive correlation with satisfaction.

## Analysis: Meaning and Impact

An interesting intersection here is that the methodology for removing bias in artificial intelligence can be structurally applied to the process of recognizing and overcoming human social programming. AI bias mitigation techniques are divided into three stages: pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing. This framework can be a useful tool for human cognitive bias mitigation strategies.

Pre-processing corresponds to environmental redesign that blocks the inflow of biased information and exposes individuals to diverse perspectives. This can be interpreted as a correction of the socialization process. In-processing techniques are similar to metacognition and mindfulness, which involve real-time recognition and suppression of one's own biases during the judgment process. Finally, post-processing is substituted with the process of reviewing the output of the intuitive System 1 with the logical System 2 to modify the final judgment.

## Practical Application: Methods Readers Can Use

We can inspect our inherent code as if debugging an AI system. First, develop a metacognitive habit of asking at the moment of decision, "Is this my genuine thought, or is it code implanted by society or instinct?" This is real-time monitoring, equivalent to AI in-processing bias mitigation.

Second, diversify your information diet. An environment that repeatedly exposes you to only specific viewpoints reinforces bias. Intentionally exposing yourself to opposing opinions or new cultural contexts is an environmental redesign akin to AI's pre-processing stage. Finally, for important decisions, do not rely on immediate intuition but go through a post-processing review process by taking time to reconsider.

## FAQ

Q: Is it possible to completely remove 'innate code'?
A: Complete removal is impossible, as it is itself part of human functioning. The goal is to recognize the existence of the code, identify when it operates inappropriately, and supplement it with conscious judgment. While some reprogramming is possible through neuroplasticity, it does not erase fundamental biological foundations.

Q: What is the biggest difference when applying AI bias mitigation techniques to humans?
A: AI algorithms are mathematical and explicit, whereas human neural circuits and social learning are far more complex and dynamic. AI can replace datasets, but humans deal with biases deeply rooted in personal experience and identity. The success rate of human application has not yet been clinically standardized.

Q: Are social codes, like views on marriage, harder for individuals to recognize?
A: Yes. Because they are internalized more subtly through the socialization process than biological instincts. It is difficult to distinguish whether a specific view on marriage is a universal truth or a product of a specific culture and era. This is especially true because such codes are often combined with moral and religious authority.

## Conclusion

Free will is not a choice from a blank state but an active cognitive process exercised within the tension between countless coded values. We cannot become perfectly de-coded beings, but through the practice of understanding and debugging our own systems, we can move closer to being freer agents. The journey begins by looking back at one decision made today and searching for the code that operated within it.
