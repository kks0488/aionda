## TL;DR

- Model aliases can route to different snapshots, like `2025-12-15` versus `2025-10-06`.  
- This can affect drift triage, since sampling and safety behaviors can also change outputs.  
- Pin snapshots where available, verify parameters like `temperature 0–1`, and log refusal signals.

A support bot can answer well for a week.  
Then its answers can become off-base on one day.  
Operators often notice this change by feel.  
That approach can blur the cause.  
Service quality improves when drift becomes reproducible.  

Example: A customer repeats a familiar question. The reply shifts in tone and detail. Someone adjusts the prompt, but results keep changing. The logs show refusal hints and partial outputs.  

The core issue is straightforward.  
Even with the same model alias, outputs can vary over time.  
Causes can include routing changes, safety behavior, and sampling randomness.  
This memo describes procedures that can reduce ambiguity.

## Current situation

Outputs can change when an alias points to a different snapshot.  
OpenAI documentation says snapshots can lock a specific version.  
That lock is intended to improve consistency of behavior.  

OpenAI’s Changelog includes alias moves to dated snapshots.  
The `gpt-realtime-mini` and `gpt-audio-mini` slugs moved to `2025-12-15`.  
If you need the previous model snapshots, use `gpt-realtime-mini-2025-10-06`.  
A drift report can trigger a documentation check for alias binding changes.  
It can also trigger a comparison against the earlier snapshot.  

Reproducibility can vary by environment and SDK layer.  
Anthropic’s OpenAI SDK compatibility docs define `temperature` as 0 to 1.  
That suggests some variance controls may not work on that path.  

Safety behavior can also change the response shape.  
OpenAI describes safe-completions as substitute or shortened responses.  
Anthropic says streaming interventions can set `stop_reason` to `"refusal"`.  
Anthropic also notes a refusal message may not be included.  
Short or cut-off answers can reflect safety mechanisms.  
They may not reflect core model capability.

## Analysis

“Performance drift” can hide several distinct causes.  
It can help to separate three categories.  

1) **The model (or snapshot) itself changed**  
2) **The model is the same, but sampling causes variance**  
3) **Safety filters changed the response shape**  

Mixing categories can weaken causal attribution.  
An alias move to `2025-12-15` can look like a prompt failure.  
That can lead to prompt edits without a stable baseline.  
Randomness can also look like a model update.  
That can lead to false confidence in snapshot pinning alone.  

Version pinning can have limits.  

- Providers can differ in whether they offer snapshot pinning.  
  This post only cites OpenAI snapshots and Changelog examples.  
  It also cites Anthropic compatibility-layer parameter notes.  
- Safety behavior can affect perceived quality even with a pinned snapshot.  
  Examples include safe-completions and `stop_reason: "refusal"`.  
- Reproducibility tools can behave differently across environments.  
  The compatibility docs say `temperature` is 0–1.  
  They also say values above 1 are capped at 1.  
  They also say `seed` is “Ignored.”  

System design can separate what gets pinned from what gets observed.  
Pinned items can include snapshots, parameters, and test inputs.  
Observed items can include refusals, interruptions, and routing changes.

## Practical application

In If/Then form:

- **If** an alias moves to a new snapshot, **Then** consider using the snapshot in production.  
  You can compare current versus previous snapshots on the same test set.  
  Snapshot notation can look like `2025-12-15` and `2025-10-06`.  

- **If** your calling path supports `seed`, **Then** include it in regression tests with `temperature`.  
  This can make model or filter changes easier to notice.  
  **If** `seed` is documented as “Ignored,” **Then** plan for repeated sampling.  
  That can reduce reliance on single-output comparisons.  

- **If** answers get shorter or appear cut off, **Then** check safety metadata first.  
  Anthropic mentions `stop_reason: "refusal"` during streaming.  
  OpenAI describes substitute responses like safe-completions.  
  Evaluation can include refusal and interruption labels, not only accuracy.  

**Checklist for Today:**
- Review alias calls and note where a snapshot or version string can be specified.  
- Create regression tests with fixed prompts, fixed inputs, and stated parameter ranges.  
- Log model identifiers and refusal or interruption signals alongside each response.

## FAQ

**Q1. When a user report says “performance got worse,” what should I check first?**  
A. Start by confirming whether you called the same model.  
If you used an alias, check whether it moved to another snapshot.  
If possible, compare against `2025-10-06` using the same test inputs.  

**Q2. If I fix the seed, is it often reproducible?**  
A. It may depend on the calling path and provider behavior.  
Anthropic’s compatibility docs mark `seed` as “Ignored.”  
This post does not include evidence of uniform behavior across all paths.  

**Q3. Can we prevent safety filters from causing quality instability?**  
A. A practical goal can be detection and handling in system design.  
OpenAI describes safe-completions as a possible substitute response.  
Anthropic mentions `stop_reason: "refusal"` during streaming.  
Products can branch on refusal or interruption and use fallbacks.

## Conclusion

Performance drift is often a measurement problem.  
It can help to separate snapshots, sampling parameters, and safety behavior.  
Documentation can identify a drift window, like `2025-12-15`.  
Pin what you can, and log what you cannot pin.  
Then investigate changes with comparative tests and metadata.
