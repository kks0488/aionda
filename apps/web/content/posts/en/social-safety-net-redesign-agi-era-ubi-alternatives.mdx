# Redesigning Social Safety Nets for the AGI Era: The Allure of UBI and Realistic Alternatives

As the advent of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) foretells fundamental changes to the labor market, the discussion on redesigning social safety nets demands practical policy frameworks beyond theoretical discourse. The core issue is that during the transitional period of technological advancement, strengthening tangible social safety nets must take precedence over the grand narrative of 'labor liberation.' This process must simultaneously address two challenges: the weakening function of existing redistribution systems and deepening income inequality.

## Current Landscape: Data on UBI's Fiscal Burden and Efficiency

Research from NBER and IMF clearly reveals the practical constraints of Universal Basic Income (UBI). An NBER study analyzed that introducing a UBI at the level of $10,000 per person in the United States would require approximately $3 trillion in annual funding, significantly exceeding the existing social safety net budget. When comparing the same budget scale, UBI was found to be less efficient at alleviating poverty than existing targeted welfare programs.

IMF analysis adds nuanced conditions to this conclusion. In advanced countries with well-established administrative infrastructure, targeted social assistance is still evaluated as a more effective policy tool. However, it points out that in specific situations where administrative capacity is weak or a fundamental overhaul of existing subsidy systems is needed, UBI can be a practical alternative. Nonetheless, research results on the long-term macroeconomic impacts of UBI suggested by some recent experimental studies are still inconsistent.

## Analysis: Fiscal Design Between Efficiency and Equity

These research findings provide important implications for policy design during the AGI transition. First, policy efficiency becomes crucial to maximize social protection under limited fiscal resources. Rather than simply pursuing universality, mechanisms must be designed to concentrate resources on genuinely vulnerable groups. Since job displacement due to AGI will occur differentially depending on specific industries and skill levels, the targeting of policies is expected to become even more important.

Second, the severe income inequality caused by technological advancement and globalization must become a new focus for redistribution policies. In a situation where existing systems are weakening, a multi-layered safety net is needed—one that goes beyond simple cash transfers to encompass retraining, revitalization of local economies, and the creation of new forms of public employment. While the UBI discussion can be a starting point for this comprehensive redesign debate, it is not the sole solution.

## Practical Application: A Framework for Policymakers

Policymakers considering the redesign of social safety nets for the AGI era can focus on several principles. First, they must start with a diagnosis of the existing system. It is essential to first assess whether current welfare and retraining programs can absorb the unemployment shock caused by AGI and to examine the robustness of the administrative infrastructure.

Next, policy options must be evaluated along the axes of efficiency, equity, and fiscal sustainability. UBI is one option, but a comparative assessment with other policy tools—such as strengthened unemployment assistance, wage subsidies, comprehensive retraining programs, and sector-specific transition support—is essential. The ultimate goal is to establish institutional mechanisms that distribute the fruits of technological progress fairly while maintaining social cohesion.

## FAQ

**Q: Can UBI really not replace all welfare programs?**
A: According to NBER and IMF research, UBI is less efficient than existing targeted programs in terms of poverty reduction per the same fiscal expenditure. Particularly, if it replaces programs tailored to specific needs like healthcare, housing, and disability support, there is a risk that the welfare of vulnerable groups could actually decrease.

**Q: Could UBI be a better choice in countries with insufficient administrative capacity?**
A: IMF analysis suggests this possibility. In cases where there is a lack of administrative capacity to operate complex eligibility procedures or where inefficient subsidy systems need fundamental reform, UBI can be a relatively simple and transparent alternative.

**Q: Will mass unemployment due to AGI change the debate on introducing UBI?**
A: Mass unemployment will rapidly increase the need for social safety nets. However, this does not resolve the fundamental questions about UBI's fiscal feasibility and efficiency. Even under extreme labor demand shocks, fiscal costs and the efficiency of resource allocation remain core considerations in policy design.

## Conclusion

As we face the transition to AGI, the task of redesigning social safety nets should start from evidence-based analysis of policy efficiency, rather than clinging to the attractive but costly single solution of UBI. The goal should not be universality itself, but rather building a robust and flexible system that effectively protects those most vulnerable to the shocks of technological change while enhancing the adaptive capacity of society as a whole. It is time for policymakers to review all tools to achieve the dual objectives of fiscal sustainability and social equity.
