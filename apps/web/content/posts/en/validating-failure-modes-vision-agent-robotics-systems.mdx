The sensor feed shakes at night.  
A vision model labels something that *looks like* a target as a “target.”  
An agent proposes a next action.  
A robot starts moving.  
What matters is not only “getting the right answer.”  
It also matters how the system fails.  
False positives and false negatives are central.  
Uncertainty signaling also matters.  
Failure propagation across the stack also matters.

Under the assumption that hallucinations have decreased to a level comparable to competing models, this article discusses decision criteria.  
The focus is a combined vision–robotics–agent system.  
The setting is a high-risk environment, such as a battlefield.  
The key point is about validation order.  
An integrated failure-mode frame should come before single-model benchmark scores.  
A single officially recognized integrated standard was not confirmed in the search results.  
A practical approach is to overlay protocols by axis.  
Then weave them into a safety case.

## TL;DR
- This describes decision criteria for integrated vision, agent, and robotics validation under lower-hallucination assumptions.  
- It matters because small perception errors can propagate into physical actions under OOD and corrupted inputs.  
- Next, combine text, detection, vision robustness, and closed-loop simulation into one stop-rule pipeline.

Example: A patrol route enters a confusing area. Dust and glare reduce sensor clarity. The system signals uncertainty. The agent pauses and proposes a safer alternative. A human operator reviews the situation.

## TL;DR
- **What changed / core issue?** Hallucinations may be lower. Validation focus can shift toward uncertainty, failure modes, and closed-loop testing.  
- **Why does it matter?** In high-risk settings, false positives, false negatives, OOD shift, and corruption can trigger control actions. Safety and compliance risk can rise.  
- **What should readers do?** Bundle TruthfulQA, FEVER, FActScore, HaluEval, and vision robustness tests. Add simulator closed-loop evaluation. Define If/Then stop rules before pilots.

## Status
LLM hallucination and factuality evaluations often split into two groups.  
One group uses benchmarks with answers and evidence.  
Another group verifies atomic facts in long-form generation.  
TruthfulQA has **817 questions**.  
It spans **38 categories**, including health, law, finance, and politics.  
FEVER targets **185,445 claims**.  
It labels them Supported, Refuted, or NotEnoughInfo.  
These benchmarks emphasize evidence-grounded correctness.

Some work measures hallucination as “detection,” not generation.  
HaluEval positions itself as a large-scale hallucination evaluation benchmark.  
A paper snippet reports about **19.5%** hallucination on user queries for ChatGPT.  
That figure depends on the study setting and model.  
It likely needs confirmation before broader use.  
For long-form generation, multiple facts per sentence can be a stress point.  
FActScore decomposes outputs into **atomic facts**.  
It scores the proportion supported by reliable knowledge sources.

On the multimodal side, distribution shift and input corruption are common stress tests.  
VQA-CP v2 aims to reduce “language prior” shortcuts.  
It changes answer distributions between train and test by question type.  
ImageNet-C includes **15 corruptions × 5 severity levels**.  
It enables robustness comparisons under common corruptions.  
A paper snippet shows ResNet-50 mCE figures before and after adaptation.  
Some multimodal work systematizes corruptions across modalities.  
One snippet mentions **96 visual and 87 text corruptions**.

Robotics and agent reliability often uses V&V and evidence management language.  
One document confirmed in search results is NASA-STD-8739.8.  
It describes software assurance, software safety, and independent V&V.  
It frames these across the full life cycle.  
A battlefield-integrated vision–agent–robot protocol was not confirmed in results.  
Adoption may combine multiple standards, benchmarks, and simulations.

## Analysis
In battlefield settings, lower hallucinations are only a starting assumption.  
An integrated system links perception, planning, and control in series.  
A small perception false positive can become a reinforced “goal” in planning.  
That goal can convert into physical action in control.  
Physical consequences can become difficult to undo.  
So improved text factuality scores may not imply integrated safety.

The handling of “I don’t know” is another key issue.  
A language model can fabricate an answer.  
A multimodal system can sound confident with unstable inputs.  
OOD splits like VQA-CP v2 probe these failure patterns.  
Corruption suites like ImageNet-C also probe them.  
Battlefield OOD can include smoke, backlighting, occlusion, and sensor noise.  
It can also include intentional tampering.  
Decision memos often benefit from worst-case failure questions.  
They can focus on stopping behavior under stress.

Lower hallucinations may still help deployment readiness.  
Atomic-fact scoring like FActScore can track long-form error patterns.  
Detection frameworks like HaluEval can track hallucination patterns.  
These tools are mainly text-centric.  
Battlefield risk often comes from closed-loop failures.  
Perception errors and action errors can combine.  
Text benchmarks alone may provide limited audit evidence.  
Certification arguments may need closed-loop validation evidence.

## Practical application
A practitioner-friendly approach is to combine evaluations.  
For text factuality, use TruthfulQA, FEVER, and FActScore.  
TruthfulQA includes **817 items** across **38 categories**.  
FEVER includes **185,445 claims**.  
FActScore uses atomic fact verification.  
For hallucination detection, include HaluEval as a separate axis.  
For vision, include OOD splits like VQA-CP v2.  
Also include corruption curves using ImageNet-C **15×5** settings.

Then convert results into operating rules.  
Dashboards alone may not drive safe behavior.  
Define If/Then rules tied to uncertainty or stress conditions.  
When uncertainty rises under OOD or corruption, an agent can pause.  
It can request re-observation or additional sensor checks.  
It can also request human approval.  
An official uncertainty calibration metric standard was not confirmed in results.  
Internal criteria may be needed.  
External grounding may need additional confirmation.

**Checklist for Today:**
- Create one report template that includes TruthfulQA, FEVER, FActScore, HaluEval, and vision stress tests.  
- Under OOD and corruption, label failures as false positive, false negative, delay, or failure-to-stop.  
- Define If/Then stop and escalation rules, and track them with closed-loop simulator scenarios.

## FAQ
**Q1. If hallucinations decrease, does the biggest obstacle to battlefield deployment disappear?**  
A1. Some obstacles can shrink.  
OOD, sensor corruption, and perception false positives can still dominate.  
TruthfulQA **817**, FEVER **185,445**, and FActScore assess language-output factuality.  
Action safety can need separate closed-loop validation evidence.

**Q2. Can integrated-system validation be finished with a single ‘standard’?**  
A2. Based on the search results, a single officially recognized integrated protocol was not confirmed.  
NASA-STD-8739.8 exists for software assurance and independent V&V.  
An integrated safety case may still require multiple standards and simulations.
