## TL;DR
- Qwen 3 expands training to 36 trillion tokens and supports 119 languages.
- The 32B model offers improved efficiency and a Thinking Mode for complex reasoning.
- Users can evaluate latency and Korean context retention before transitioning to the new model.

Example: Someone contemplates which path to take amidst an endless pile of characters flowing over a dark screen. Fingers hover over keys, feeling conflicted between familiar tools and new technology. Shifting models involves more than comparing values; it is about implementing thought within a specific linguistic context.

The transition from Qwen 2.5 to Qwen 3 involves larger training datasets and broader language support. This update offers potential changes for those processing Korean text. The design inherits features from previous versions while attempting a technical transition.

## Current Status
Qwen 3 uses 36 trillion tokens for its training process. This amount doubles the data used for the previous version. The model now supports 119 languages and various dialects. This strategy aims for versatility in multilingual environments.


## Analysis
Higher efficiency in the 32B model could lower costs for fine-tuning. Users may require less expensive hardware to achieve high performance levels. This change might reduce barriers for those building Korean language services.

Thinking Mode can provide step-by-step reasoning for complex requests. Korean context often contains ambiguity that requires careful logic. Step-by-step reasoning may be advantageous for legal or technical document summarization. However, broader language support might decrease the density of Korean data. The understanding of unique Korean styles may not improve as expected. The data cutoff in early 2025 has limitations for reflecting recent events.

## Practical Application
Developers should choose models based on their specific needs for speed and logic. Thinking Mode can improve accuracy but might slow down response times. It is suitable for tasks involving math or code. Simple conversations can use faster modes or earlier versions.

**Checklist for Today:**
- Compare sentence naturalness between the 32B and 72B models using Korean prompts.
- Evaluate how much the Thinking Mode latency affects the overall user experience.
- Monitor token usage for identical phrases to check the efficiency of the new tokenizer.

## FAQ
**Q: What is the proportion of Korean training data in Qwen 3?**
A: The technical report lists 119 languages but does not provide specific figures for Korean.

**Q: Should Qwen 2.5 users switch to Qwen 3?**
A: Efficiency gains are reported, but Korean performance requires more independent verification.

**Q: Does 'Thinking Mode' work properly in Korean?**
A: Technical reports show logic improvements in math and coding. Its effect on Korean context requires further testing.

## Conclusion
Qwen 3 focuses on data quality and better reasoning processes. It uses 36 trillion tokens to set a standard for open-source models. Future success depends on how well it handles the Korean language. Users will determine its value through actual operational testing.
