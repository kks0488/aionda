## TL;DR
- Technical limits of models and hardware constraints now influence AI strategy.
- Misunderstanding AI causes errors while resource limits impact economic viability.
- Organizations should follow NIST AI RMF and establish manual control mechanisms.

Example: When a tool meant for writing reports makes logical errors, a person becomes flustered and reviews every word. This shows a moment when trust in the technology starts to fade.

Language models now mimic human speech. This creates a need to check if AI thinks or just predicts words. Technical skepticism impacts hardware limits and labor markets. Governance remains a practical challenge. Companies can balance performance and manageable risk. They can move beyond technical illusions.

## Current Status
Expectations for emergent abilities rose as models scaled. Technical skepticism suggests models generate responses based on probability. This can cause hallucinations in unexpected situations. Performance limits appear in hardware and software. Semiconductor processing faces physical limits. The industry seeks solutions through heterogeneous integration architectures. These combine chips with different functions. Global regulatory movements are also taking shape. NIST provides guidelines through the AI Risk Management Framework. This framework uses four functions: govern, map, measure, and manage. ISO defines standards through ISO/IEC 42001. It emphasizes risk assessment and lifecycle management. OECD principles require safeguards for human intervention. Humans should be able to decommission systems if needed.

## Analysis
AI technology faces a choice between performance and reliability. Scaling models increases physical costs like power and manufacturing. Heterogeneous integration can improve power efficiency. Increased design complexity creates a trade-off. Economic momentum might weaken if hardware lags behind software. Reliability risks are notable. If models lack logic, their use in specialized fields is often limited. NIST identifies seven characteristics of trustworthiness. These include safety, security, and transparency. OECD safeguards help fill the accountability gap. Skepticism helps identify and fix system flaws early.

## Practical Application
Organizations should evaluate management systems before adopting technology. It is helpful to build systems that measure data flows and risks.

**Checklist for Today:**
- Categorize risk factors of operational models using the four NIST AI RMF core functions.
- Formalize procedures for human review and manual intervention to stop the system when necessary.
- Conduct technical audits to ensure transparency and explainability meet organizational requirements.

## FAQ
**Q: If LLMs lack reasoning capabilities, can they not be applied to complex tasks?**
A: One can use AI as a draft writer or assistant. Design should include human review in the final judgment stage.

**Q: Will the physical limits of hardware stop AI development?**
A: Single-chip performance may slow down. New packaging and specialized architectures are compensating for this. Rising costs make economic reviews crucial.

**Q: Are NIST AI RMF or ISO 42001 certifications mandatory?**
A: These are currently voluntary standards in many cases. They may become de facto standards for global markets. Preemptive adoption helps manage legal risk.

## Conclusion
Skeptical views are milestones to face as technology matures. Structural limits and hardware constraints show how to control AI. Future competitiveness depends on cost-effective systems that meet safety standards. Governance should examine technical possibilities while managing limitations.
