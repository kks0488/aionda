## TL;DR
- ZDNET tested a trick question on **six** popular AIs to observe hallucination-like failures.  
- Plausible errors can raise verification costs and reduce trust, and one snippet reports **0%** vs **6%** rates.  
- Build If/Then rules, add evidence workflows like RAG, and validate with a small evaluation set.  

A user reads a confident answer to a trick question and makes a decision without checking sources.  
That situation can turn a plausible mistake into operational risk.  
ZDNET explored this pattern by posing a trick question to **six** popular AIs.  
The setup reflects common workplace inputs that look simple but hide traps.  
The key issue is how systems handle uncertainty and evidence.  

Example: A team drafts a report from internal materials. The model adds convincing support. Later, reviewers find the support is incorrect. The team rewrites the report and adjusts the workflow.  

## Current state

Trick questions can expose how a model produces plausible errors.  
Those errors can increase a user’s verification burden.  
In ZDNET excerpts, the author frames chatbot errors as a known risk.  
The author then tests a trick question on leading tools.  
The excerpt supports only a small set of checkable claims.  

- The test targeted **six** “popular AIs.”  
- The experiment is framed as “hallucination roulette.”  

The excerpt does not confirm model names, prompts, or scoring.  
It also does not provide accuracy or error rates for the six models.  
Those details require the full article or related materials.  

Mitigations are often discussed in research and practice.  
They commonly fall into four groups.  

- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: The model can cite external sources, not only parameters.  
- **CoT (Chain-of-Thought)**: The model can show steps that create intermediate checks.  
- **Self-Correction**: The model can re-check its answer for inconsistencies.  
- **Knowledge Graph**: Structured entities and relationships can improve traceability and consistency.  

Quantitative evidence is limited in the cited scope.  
One PubMed-indexed snippet reports a specific comparison under CIS information use.  
It reports **GPT-4 at 0%** hallucination and **GPT-3.5 at 6%** hallucination.  
These results are conditional and may not generalize across tasks.  
They also do not directly validate results for the six-AI ZDNET test.  

## Analysis

The decision risk is not only model capability.  
It is also operating rules for when to trust outputs.  
Trick questions can resemble real work inputs.  
Examples include policies, contract clauses, and specifications.  
Risk rises when answers sound plausible and go unchecked.  
That gap can increase QA effort and rework time.  
It can also raise customer support costs and compliance exposure.  

Mitigations can add costs and trade-offs.  

- RAG depends on search quality, indexing, and access control.  
- RAG also depends on source credibility and citation handling.  
- CoT and self-correction can increase token and latency costs.  
- Longer outputs can still be wrong in some cases.  
- Knowledge graphs can add build and maintenance overhead.  
- They also require updates as the domain changes.  

The goal can shift from eliminating hallucinations to managing them.  
Tasks can be separated by risk and evidence needs.  
Some tasks can justify RAG by default.  
Some tasks can benefit from human approval.  
Some tasks can remain manual if risk is high.  

## Practical application

A task-level memo can be easier to reproduce than model ranking.  
A few trick questions rarely match real organizational workloads.  
Instead, classify your question types and likely failure modes.  
Then attach safeguards by category.  

- **If** the answer depends on facts **Then** use RAG and require citations.  
- **If** the answer needs multi-step reasoning **Then** use step structure and checkpoints.  
- **If** the answer includes a decision **Then** add self-correction or human approval.  

**Checklist for Today:**
- Categorize frequent questions into fact, reasoning, and decision types.  
- Add RAG for fact-type questions and block submission without citations.  
- Create a small evaluation set and log correctness and citation presence.  

## FAQ

**Q1. What is the most realistic single prescription to reduce hallucinations?**  
A. RAG is often a practical starting point.  
It can reduce unsupported fabrication by attaching sources.  
The effect can be limited if retrieval and source design are weak.  

**Q2. Does using CoT (Chain-of-Thought) make it more accurate?**  
A. Step structure can help reveal mistakes earlier.  
It creates checkpoints for targeted verification.  
Longer explanations do not automatically imply correctness.  

**Q3. Which is the safest among the ‘six popular AIs’?**  
A. The excerpt does not support a ranked comparison.  
A separate snippet reports **0%** versus **6%** under a specific condition.  
That difference may not transfer to your tasks or datasets.  
You can test stability on your data with the same safeguards.  

## Conclusion

Trick-question testing highlights a user-facing failure mode.  
A plausible answer can become operational risk without evidence checks.  
Start with rules that require evidence for factual claims.  
Use RAG for citations, and use structured reasoning for checkpoints.  
Add self-correction and knowledge graphs where traceability matters.  
Then measure consistency of evidenced answers across your evaluation set.
