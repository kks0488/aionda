The era of the artificial intelligence 'black box' is fading as the internal engine room begins to be unveiled. While users previously had to accept AI outputs without question, we are now entering an era where one can observe the logical steps a model takes to derive an answer in real-time. Led by OpenAI's GPT 5.2 and Anthropic's Claude 4.5, the 'Open Responses' framework is moving beyond mere transparency, fundamentally reshaping the paradigm for verifying AI reliability.

### Opening 'Reasoning Logs' to Deconstruct the Black Box

As of January 2026, the hot topic in the AI industry is no longer the 'number of parameters.' The core lies in how sophisticatedly a model thinks and how honestly it reveals that process. OpenAI’s 'Responses API,' introduced alongside GPT 5.2, stands at the pinnacle of this shift. This API permanently maintains the model's reasoning logs (Chain-of-Thought) and encrypted intermediate data, providing limited access to external developers.

Technical achievements are proven by data. According to OpenAI’s internal data, making reasoning processes transparent has reduced hallucinations in complex multi-step tasks by 30% to as much as 38% compared to previous levels. The very fact that a model records its own thought process serves as a 'monitoring system' that self-corrects logical errors. This signifies a shift in evaluation methods from a focus on static benchmark scores to dynamic verification based on actual user feedback.

Conversely, the open-source camp, led by DeepSeek-V4, is taking a different path. While GPT 5.2 focuses on making the 'results of thought' transparent, DeepSeek-V4 exposes the entire 'infrastructure of thought.' They have opened the entire training pipeline, including the distributed file system (3FS) and the data preprocessing framework, Smallpond. While proprietary SOTA models build trust through encrypted intermediate weights, open-source models choose a strategy of technical democratization through reproducible code.

### Self-Improving AI: The Loop of Autonomous Evolution

The true value of this technological shift lies in the completion of 'self-improving' models. Previously, AI was a passive entity learning from human-provided data; however, GPT 5.2 evolves independently through 'Deductive Closure Training' and the 'SEAL' framework.

As response data and reasoning logs are opened, the AI reviews its own logical consistency. Telemetry data generated during this process, combined with real-time user feedback, acts as a teacher to fine-tune the model's weights. In other words, every instance of a user correcting or criticizing an AI response becomes fuel for the learning engine that aligns the model's performance.

This dynamic optimization system transforms AI from being trapped in static datasets into an organic entity that grows in real-world environments. However, it is not without its drawbacks. The scope of disclosure for intermediate weight data and the criteria for 'verified experts' allowed to access encrypted data remain subjects of debate. Concerns persist that technical transparency could lead to the leakage of core intellectual property or create new security vulnerabilities.

### New Challenges Facing Developers and Corporations

Developers must now move beyond 'prompt engineering'—which optimizes only the output—and acquire 'logic debugging' capabilities to analyze and correct the model's reasoning logs. Using the GPT 5.2 Responses API, one can pinpoint exactly where a model makes a logical leap. This is expected to trigger the accelerated adoption of AI in specialized fields such as medicine, law, and finance, where there is no room for error.

For corporations, the key will be how to integrate real-time data verification policies into their own services. Rather than simply connecting to an API, companies must design unique 'feedback loops' that link user feedback to model performance improvements to gain a competitive advantage.

### FAQ

**Q1: How does GPT 5.2's Open Responses policy differ from previous models?**
A1: While previous models provided only the final output, GPT 5.2 reveals the reasoning process (Chain-of-Thought) and encrypted intermediate data through the Responses API. This has reduced hallucinations by 30–38% and allows developers to track and verify the model's logical flow in real-time.

**Q2: What is the decisive difference compared to the open-source DeepSeek-V4?**
A2: GPT 5.2 and Claude 4.5 take a closed approach focusing on 'reasoning transparency' and 'real-time feedback.' In contrast, DeepSeek-V4 employs an 'infrastructure democratization' strategy, releasing the entire infrastructure, including the 3FS (distributed file system) and data preprocessing frameworks, so the community can verify the technology from its foundation.

**Q3: Is self-improving AI actually at a feasible stage?**
A3: Yes. Through Deductive Closure Training and the SEAL framework, models have reached a stage where they can verify the logical consistency of the data they generate. By using real-time user feedback as telemetry to fine-tune weights, the models continuously improve performance to suit real-world environments rather than remaining static.

### Conclusion: Facing Intelligence Beyond the Glass Wall

AI is no longer a mysterious oracle. The transparency of reasoning demonstrated by GPT 5.2 and Claude 4.5 is transforming AI into a 'transparent machine' that we can control and improve. The core of technology no longer depends on how large a model is, but on how sophisticatedly its thought process is designed and opened to earn trust. We are witnessing 'intelligent evolution' in its truest sense, where artificial intelligence proves and corrects itself.
