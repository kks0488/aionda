## TL;DR
- Claude Code is described as a CLI agent that uses shell and file access with a plan–execute–verify loop.  
- This shifts focus toward permissions, verification evidence, and review standards over raw code output.  
- Run a PoC around permissions, verification, and review templates before broader adoption.  

A user runs a CLI agent that executes commands, reads logs, and edits files in one loop.  
This behavior is described in an Anthropic engineering document dated 2025-04-18.  
WIRED also discussed this workflow through an interview with Claude Code lead Boris Cherny.  

Example: A developer sees recurring failures in a build. The agent reads logs and drafts changes. A reviewer checks intent and evidence before merging.  

## Current state
Terminal-based development flows increasingly treat AI as an executing actor, not only an assistant.  
Claude Code is described as a “command line tool for agentic coding.”  
That phrasing appears in an Anthropic engineering document dated 2025-04-18.  
The workflow is premised on shell and file system access.  

Two distinguishing traits are Tool Use and a plan–execute–verify loop.  
After code changes, the agent can run tests, read errors, and iterate further.  
An Anthropic newsroom post describes team use cases for this workflow.  
One example is Security Engineering parsing a Terraform plan for review work.  
Another example is the Inference team generating unit tests with edge cases.  

Public materials also mention internal scale in limited terms.  
Anthropic has said that about 95% of Claude Code’s own code is written by AI.  
This number appears in Anthropic news posts and introductory write-ups.  
It reflects one organization’s internal context, not a general industry baseline.  

## Analysis
The main change is the interface where engineering work gets evaluated.  
Line-level code output becomes less central for explaining progress.  
More attention moves to task decomposition, tool choices, and permissions used.  
Verification artifacts matter more, including tests run, logs read, and diffs produced.  

Reviews can shift toward intent and verification, not only syntax or style.  
That framing appears aligned with the “working change” loop described above.  

Risks appear from the same structure.  
- First, broader permissions can increase the blast radius of errors.  
Shell and file system access can enable incorrect commands and path mistakes.  
It can also raise the chance of poor secret handling.  
- Second, the plan–execute–verify loop depends on a verification floor.  
Weak tests or weak observability can increase human verification time.  
- Third, external quantitative evidence remains limited in this text.  
The about 95% figure is internal to Anthropic’s Claude Code codebase.  
External adoption rates or productivity changes are not established here.  

## Practical application
Adopting an agentic CLI tool can resemble operating an executing actor with permissions.  
It can be framed around permissions, tools, and verification gates.  
Permissions define what it can execute and which files it can access.  
Tools define standardized commands and scripts the agent can call.  
Verification defines which tests and checks should pass before review.  

Anthropic also notes tool extensions via MCP, the Model Context Protocol.  
That can help modularize repeatable tasks into callable tools.  
Examples include running tests, linting, and infrastructure plan review.  
Sandboxing can reduce risk when permissions expand.  

**Checklist for Today:**
- Limit shell and file permissions, and document forbidden commands and paths.  
- Add evidence requirements to reviews, including tests run, logs, and diff summaries.  
- Standardize one repetitive task as a script, and expose it via a tool like MCP.  

## FAQ
**Q1. How is Claude Code’s “agentic” different from IDE autocompletion?**  
A. Autocompletion often focuses on suggesting snippets.  
Claude Code is described as using shell access for multi-step execution.  
It is organized around a plan–execute–verify loop.  

**Q2. From a security team perspective, is this a win or a loss?**  
A. Outcomes can vary by permission design and review practice.  
Anthropic describes Security Engineering parsing Terraform plans to reduce bottlenecks.  
Shell and file access can also increase the blast radius if controls are weak.  
Least privilege, sandboxing, and evidence-based reviews can reduce risk.  

**Q3. Should we take internal numbers like “95% of code changes” at face value?**  
A. It is more accurate to treat about 95% as an internal Anthropic claim.  
It is tied to Claude Code’s own codebase, per cited public materials.  
It does not establish averages for other organizations.  
External effects would need separate validation beyond this text.  

## Conclusion
Claude Code illustrates a shift toward AI acting as an executing CLI workflow participant.  
It is described as holding shell access and using tools to finish tasks.  
The operational question becomes permissioning, verification, and review design.  
These elements can help turn speed into controllable execution.
