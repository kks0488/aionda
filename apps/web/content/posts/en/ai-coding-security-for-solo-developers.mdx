## TL;DR
- AI tools help build services faster but bring security risks to solo development projects.
- Frameworks from OWASP and NIST label AI code as untrusted because it can contain vulnerabilities.
- Developers should combine AI output with manual reviews and security tools for safer results.

Example: A developer sends script segments to a chat interface to fix a logic error in data processing. The assistant finds flaws and offers a better way to handle the information flow.

## Current Status
Solo developers now use AI assistants for fast feature prototyping. These tools help write code and set up deployment pipelines. This shift lowers technical barriers for creators.


## Analysis
High productivity requires a balance between speed and safety. AI optimizations may look good but often lack security context. No current technical standards ensure the accuracy of AI code reviews. 

Development with AI should be seen as augmented work. It is not a path to full automation. NIST guidelines focus on human intervention for security plans. AI code needs the same review as unverified external libraries.

## Practical Application
Solo developers can adopt security frameworks to manage risks. A separate verification step helps find logic flaws.

**Checklist for Today:**
- Treat AI-generated code as untrusted input and use security tools for verification.
- Create a security checklist for output handling based on OWASP guidelines.
- Review critical code like permission management manually and line by line.

## FAQ
**Q: Are there official tools to check for security vulnerabilities in AI-written code?**
A: No single standard exists to ensure the accuracy of AI reviews. You can reduce risks by using OWASP or NIST frameworks.

**Q: When can we check the NIST AI security guidelines?**

**Q: Is security review necessary even at the prototyping stage?**
A: Yes. Early flaws increase costs when a service scales. It is better not to trust AI code from the start.

## Conclusion
AI gives solo developers more productivity than before. Guidelines from 2025 and 2026 highlight the need for control. Finding vulnerabilities behind technical convenience is now an essential skill. Managing AI code security will determine if a service survives.
